B>Summary
B>
B>-Yesterday's hearing confirmed imminent death of SoCal MOU
B>-Plan(s) B also drew little support; state "trust" for generators unlikely
B>-QF/SoCal negotiations are "treading water" as SoCal runs out the clock; 
B>tries to postpone involuntary filing
B>-BK court unlikely to view SoCal payments to QFs as preferential because of 
B>state order
B>
B>Report
B>
B>1. Few Signs of Legislative Support for SoCal MOU
B>
B>Sources report that Bryson is in regular contact with many legislators,
B>but especially with Hertzberg and Keeley on the Assembly side (from which
B>the Plan B is being directed) and Bowen (Senate Energy Chairperson) on the
B>Assembly side.  Sources believe that Bryson's comment may about the
B>legislature 'warming up to the MOU' may be a smokescreen; Democratic Senator
B>Alarcon said in the MOU hearing yesterday that the MOU is dead and is not
B>going to pass.  Reportedly no one attempted to contradict him.
B>
B>Members of the Chamber of Commerce, large energy users,  TURN, the California 
B>Manufacturers' and Technology Association (CMTA) and  others also spoke out 
B>against the MOU.  (Sources found it remarkable that  TURN and the CMTA, who 
B>have been rivals in Plan B negotiations, agreed with each  other in strongly 
B>attacking the MOU.
B>
B>2. Plan(s) B Are Still Foundering
B>
B> The Plan(s) B were not discussed at the hearing, though some of the same
B>issues came up.  For instance, it was discussed whether it was possible to
B>transfer all of Edison's obligations to a trust that pays out after the
B>conclusion of litigation.  In the opinion of the governor's counsel and
B>other lawyers present, this is "shaky," especially without the consent of
B>creditors.  In their opinion, there would have to be an agreement that would
B>pay off everything.
B>
B>The governor's counsel stated there were constitutional problems with setting 
B>up a trust for what the generators are owed, then letting them litigate over 
B>the trust.  Also, he stated that it was not feasible for the state to be 
B>offering generators cash on the one hand while the FERC negotiated with them 
B>to refund the state for power
B>purchases (as ordered in the FERC decision Monday).  The governor's counsel
B>stated that the only reasonable thing for the state to do was to give the
B>generators their cash, then sue them for it.
B>
B>3. QF/SoCal Negotiations Are "Treading Water"
B>
B> QF sources suggest that the debate between SoCal and the PUC as to whether
B>the QFs should be paid 10% or 15% of what they are owed is "not a real
B>question," but rather a stalling measure allowing SoCal to hold on to cash
B>in advance of a filing or a global solution.  "SoCal is just treading water," 
B>said a source.
B>
B>
B>4. SoCal Payments to QFs Unlikely to be Viewed As Preference  Payments
B>
B>Sources also comment that SoCal payments to the QFs likely would not be
B>seen as a preference payment in bankruptcy court because they were ordered
B>by a state agency, the PUC.  However, comments made in the SoCal conference
B>call yesterday seem to indicate that Solomon Smith and perhaps other
B>creditors may see the payments this way and may be willing to sign a
B>bankruptcy petition.
