For\nthe current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using\nthe previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current \ngas\nday is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for\n3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was \nin\nfact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the\nchange is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the\nFirst-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the\nfirst-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If\ntoday is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect \nto\nthe first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional\npurchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet\nshould be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that \nwe\ntake or turn back.   The column labelled \"ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'\nshows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at\npre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or\nfor swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be \nnegotiated.\n'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.\n\n\n\n\n\nHans Herzog\nph: 703 561 6331\nfax: 703 561 7317\n\n - 07-31A-00 daily vols.xls\n - 07-31B-00 daily vols.xls",
