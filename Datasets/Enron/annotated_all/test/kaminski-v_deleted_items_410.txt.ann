Weather may provide some\nshort-lived price spikes in February, but until real evidence of the\nanticipated decline in US supply appears, prices will feel continued downward\npressure from record-high storage inventories.

Ample gas remains\nto keep prices low until a rebounding economy and declining supplies can\nprovide a lift.\n\n* With return to a normal weather, strong industrial loads will boost overall\ngas demand slightly over last year's levels.\n\n* Diminishing weather-related support and high western storage inventories will\ndrive widening discounts to the Henry Hub in the western producing areas, while\nweak demand and high storage will limit premiums in the East.\n\n**end**\n\nFollow above ULR for complete CERA Monthly Briefing (7 printed pages).\n\nE-mail Category: Monthly Briefing\nCERA Knowledge Area(s): North American Gas\n\n\n\n*****************************************************************************************\nCERAWeek2002 - February 11-15, 2002 - 21st Annual Executive Conference and\nRelated Events REGISTER ONLINE TODAY AT:  http://www.cera.com/ceraweek\n** Two- and Four-day Passes Available\n** Special Enrollment Programs\n** Partnership Opportunities\n** CERAWeek Online Premium Access\n*****************************************************************************************\n\n\nTo make changes to your cera.com profile go to:\nhttp://www.cera.com/client/updateaccount\n\nForgot your username and password?
