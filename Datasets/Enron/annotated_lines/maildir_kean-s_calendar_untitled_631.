B>Gentlemen:  The California Project is now moving from phase I into phases I=
B>I=20
B>with respect to commuication/PR activities:
B>
B>Phase I--No major leak/"no comment policy".  The only communications=20
B>responses (ESA Employee Memo, Employee Q&As for Elektro and Cuiaba, and=20
B>Q&Asfor vaious stakeholders) required to date were prompted by the TV (Bom=
B>=20
B>Dia) news story and Gazeta Mercantil article. =20
B>
B>Phase II--Major leak requiring disclosure.  While prospective buyers have=
B>=20
B>signed CAs, there's always the possibility that news of the Project and/or=
B>=20
B>elements from the IM could be leaked--either inadvertently or by design. =
B>=20
B>While this scenario is unlikely, we need to be prepared to respond before=
B>=20
B>there is an actual sale of assets.  A draft press release has been prepared=
B>=20
B>for Ken Lay, confirming that Enron is considering the sale of its assets in=
B>=20
B>South America.  There is also a set of generic Q&As, which is being expande=
B>d=20
B>to include stakeholder-specific Q&As.  The ESA Employee Memo (May 8) is als=
B>o=20
B>being modified.
B>
B>Phase III--With the IM out, CAs signed and data rooms open, we should begin=
B>=20
B>to implement parts of the Communication Rollout Plan to demonstrate the=20
B>strength/success of the business strategy, limit speculation and provide=20
B>greater sense of certainty to important stakeholders.  The activities that =
B>we=20
B>can undertake now, include:
B>
B>? Contact lists--Develop comprehensive contact lists of all=20
B>audiences/stakeholders.  Include names, addresses, phone, fax,, and email. =
B>=20
B>Put into Excel format.  Identify who internally "owns" each list. =20
B>
B>? Speaking platforms--Develop list of speaking opportunities to introduce=
B>=20
B>Enron's business model and announce our regional strategy. =20

B>the region.  It will be essential that all spokespeople are delivering the=
B>=20
B>same message and are well prepared for difficult situations.=20
B>
B>? Fact sheets on individual assets =01) The information can be pulled from =
B>the=20
