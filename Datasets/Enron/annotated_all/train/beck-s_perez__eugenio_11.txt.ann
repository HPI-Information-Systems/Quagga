We \nhave started to do this by creating the VaR Limit Usage graphs and the \nSharpe, Rovar, and Risk - Return graphs.  \n\nI am sorry for the misunderstanding with Ted concerning the latter.  I had \nexplained what I wanted to produce in an e-mail and during a Risk Forum \nLuncheon.  Therefore, Shona and I did not expect the reaction we got.  I have \ntalked to Naveen and Rudi since then, and we have changed the graphs to be \nagreeable to RAC.\n\nToday I worked on the graphs below.  They show the P&L decomposition for the \nmonth (rolling 20 business days) up to 9/20 (one in dollar terms and the \nother as a percentage of P&L).  I showed them to Shona, and she thought you \nshould see them before Naveen, Rudi, and Ted, because these graphs are very \npowerful and are likely to be controversial.  The graphs show that European \nGas and UK Power released a lot of prudency.  Half of total P&L for European \nGas is prudency, and UK Power would have had a loss of about $20 million \n(instead of a gain of $27 million) were it not for prudency.   In the case of \nNorth American Gas, $46 million gain in new deals partly offset about $106 \nmillion in trading losses.  \n\nPlease note that these are rough drafts intended to show what we can do.  I \ndo not think that there are problems with the data, but I threw these \ntogether today, and I have not yet double-checked the accuracy of my \naggregating calculations.\n\nPlease launch the attached spreadsheet, and feel free to call or page me with \nquestions or concerns.\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\nEugenio\n\n\n",
