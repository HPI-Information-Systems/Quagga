(\"Enron\" or the \"Company\") =\n(NYSE: ENE) common stock during the period between January 18, 2000 and Oct=\nober 17, 2001, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). A copy of the complaint file=\nd in this action is available from the Court, or can be viewed on the firm'=\ns website at http://www.classlawyer.com/pr/enron.pdf .=20\nThe complaint charges that Enron and certain of its officers and directors =\nviolated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a=\nnd Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misre=\npresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, =\nthereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specificall=\ny, the complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concernin=\ng its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose (=\ni) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declinin=\ng demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading market=\n for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market particip=\nants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were =\nmaterially overstated as a result of the Company failing to timely write- d=\nown the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which we=\nre managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron w=\nas failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance wi=\nth GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that=\n the Company was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, o=\nr ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period =\nending September 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material por=\ntion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain lim=\nited partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer =\nand that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in sharehold=\ner equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news beg=\nan to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped=\n significantly. During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $7=\n3 million of their personally-held Enron common stock to unsuspecting inves=\ntors.\nIf you bought Enron common stock between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2=\n001, inclusive, and you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the =\nCourt no later than December 21, 2001.

All Rights Reserved. =09\n\n\nEnron Keeps Analysts Happy as Investors Flee: Call of the Day\n2001-10-23 17:08 (New York)\n\nEnron Keeps Analysts Happy as Investors Flee: Call of the Day\n\n     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Over lunch in a conference\nroom at Boston's Four Seasons Hotel last Thursday, Enron Corp.\nChairman Kenneth Lay tried to convince analysts and investors that\nthe company has no more surprises.\n\n     With the analysts, he apparently succeeded. Enron remains one\nof Wall Street's most highly rated stocks, even after the largest\nenergy trader acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run\nby its chief financial officer led to a writedown of $1.2 billion\nin shareholder equity.\n\n     Lay wasn't so successful with investors, who have abandoned\nEnron shares, slashing their value 42 percent in a week.\n\n     ``You've got a lot of people lining up to say the emperor has\nno clothes,'' said Richard Gross of Lehman Brothers Inc., who\ntoday repeated his ``strong buy'' rating on Enron. Analysts at\nCredit Suisse First Boston, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and other firms\nhave also kept their highest ratings on Enron.\n\n     Gross still likes the look of Enron's finery. ``The core\nfranchise here is very valuable,'' he said, and the stock's\ndecline more than reflects the ``worst case'' for the company.\n\n     In Boston and at similar meetings in Houston and New York,\nLay had to explain the unwinding of the partnerships. He and other\nEnron executives assured investors the company has no more\nsurprises in store, according to Greg Phelps, who manages $1.1\nbillion at John Hancock Advisers Inc., and attended the Boston\nsession.\n\n     The partnerships functioned somewhat like private equity\nfunds, according to analysts and investors, and included\ninvestments that lost money. The Securities and Exchange\nCommission has asked for more information about them, Enron said\nyesterday.\n\n                        One Hold, One Sell\n\n     While two analysts have cut their Enron ratings after\nlearning about the partnerships, they only dented the company's\npopularity on Wall Street.\n\n     Michael Heim of A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis lowered\nhis rating to ``hold'' from ``buy'' on Friday. He said he has been\nlooking for discussion of the partnerships in Enron's SEC filings\nand is only seeing ``vague references'' that don't leave him with\na ``good comfort level.''\n\n     With Heim's rating change, Enron went from being the second\nmost highly rated stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to the\n10th, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.\n\n     Today, Zach Wagner at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis cut\nEnron to ``reduce'' from ``accumulate.'' Ratings by Edward Jones,\nwhich caters to individual investors rather than institutions,\naren't tracked by First Call.\n\n     First Call translates analyst ratings into numbers, with\n``strong buy'' a one, ``buy'' a two, and so on, then averages the\nratings to rank a company's Wall Street popularity. The most\nhighly rated stock is Tyco International Ltd., which has fallen 12\npercent this year.\n\n     Enron shares fell 86 cents to $19.79 today.\n\n                        Remaining Skeptical\n\n     However highly brokerage analysts rate the stock, ``I have to\nremain skeptical,'' said Barry Borak, energy analyst at David L.\nBabson & Co., which manages $60 billion in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts.\n\n     ``There's been a huge loss of management credibility at\nEnron,'' Borak said, because of the partnerships and the\nunexpected departure in August of Jeffrey Skilling, who had held\nthe post of chief executive officer for six months and was heir\napparent to Lay. ``Nobody I've talked to thinks (Skilling's\ndeparture) is for personal reasons,'' Borak said.\n\n     Skilling helped transform Enron from a gas pipeline company\ninto the biggest energy trading company. Enron also owns power\nplants in deregulated markets.\n\n     Borak said Babson doesn't own Enron shares and won't be a\nbuyer ``until I can get better, more thorough information about\nwhat else might pop up in the future.''\n\n     Borak and other investors said Enron has a reputation for not\nproviding enough information about its businesses, and they said\nthis makes the positive view of the company on Wall Street more\ndifficult to understand.\n\n     After Skilling resigned, Lay said the company would be more\nopen about its businesses. A bullet point in his talk in Boston\nwas ``increased transparency of financial and operating results,''\naccording to a handout provided at the Boston meeting.\n\n                         Amazed, Dismayed\n\n     Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale wrote in a\nnote to clients last week that she was ``amazed at the willingness\nof Enron's management to break out earnings and expenses to the\ndegree that it disclosed in the third quarter.''\n\n     Coale also wrote that she was ``dismayed by the apparent\n`disguise' of the additional $1.2 billion equity hit that was not\ndisclosed in (Enron's) press release and was briefly mentioned in\nthe earnings conference call.'' Coale kept her rating on Enron at\n``buy.''\n\n     Phelps at John Hancock said that his ``cynical side''\nbelieves that investment banking business has helped keep Wall\nStreet recommending Enron stock. ``They provide some good\nunderwriting business,'' he said.\n\n     Credit Suisse First Boston managed a secondary sale of 12\nmillion Enron shares in 1999, with Lehman Brothers acting\nas co-manager. Credit Suisse has also managed bond sales for\nEnron this year.\n\n\n\nEnron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)\n2001-10-23 16:38 (New York)\n\nEnron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)\n\n     (Updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph.)\n\n     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest\nenergy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 million\nloan, ensuring access to credit if the company is cut off from\nmoney markets, say people familiar with the matter.\n\n     Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company\nsaid the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its\nfinances. The company depends on a $3 billion commercial paper, or\nshort-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations.\n\n     Moody's Investors Service last week placed all $13 billion of\nthe company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible\ndowngrade. Any drop in the rating may cut off Enron from the\ncommercial paper market, raising the costs of short-term debt.\n\n     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to both\nthe capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's Chief\nFinancial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.\nHe said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,\ngiving it enough cash to operate normally.\n\n     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,\ndeclined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, also\nwouldn't comment.\n\n     Shares of Enron, based in Houston, fell 86 cents to $19.79.\nThey have fallen 76 percent this year.\n\n                         Complex Financing\n\n     An investor sued Enron last week, saying dealings with two\npartnerships run by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,\ncost the company $35 million. The suit also calls Fastow's\nleadership of the partnerships, set up to remove debt from Enron's\nbooks, a conflict of interest.\n\n     Enron bought back 62 million shares to unwind positions in\nsome partnerships run by Fastow, said Chief Executive Officer Ken\nLay on the conference call with investors today.\n\n     The number of shares differs from a Wall Street Journal\nreport on Thursday that said Enron had bought back 55 million\nshares. The buyback reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion,\nthe Journal said.\n\n     The company set up the partnerships and other affiliated\ncompanies to buy Enron assets such as power plants. The\npartnerships allow Enron to take debt off its books, letting it\nborrow to invest in its main business of commodities trading,\nEnron said. Enron trades electricity, natural gas, oil, coal and\nother commodities.\n\n     ```They have complex off-balance sheet financing,'' said\nCommerzbank analyst Andre Mead. ``It's difficult to ascertain the\nfull impact on shareholders.''\n\n     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated\ncompanies headed by Fastow. The company has at least $3 billion in\nsuch ``off-the-books'' financing in affiliated companies, Ray\nNiles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to\ninvestors.\n\n                      Depends on Asset Sales\n\n     One partnership, Whitewing Management, owns 250,000 preferred\nshares that Enron may have to convert to common stock. Whitewing\npartners can demand their preferred shares be converted if Enron\ncommon stock falls below a certain price or if Enron's credit\nrating drops under investment grade.\n\n     Whitewing and other Enron partnerships and trusts include\ncompany executives as officers and directors, according to records\nfrom the Texas secretary of state.\n\n     ``Over the life of these trust structures, Enron has in fact\nissued a sizable amount of equity,'' Enron Treasurer Ben Gilsan\nsaid. Most of that was shares issued to Enron executives as part\nof a deferred compensation plan, Gilsan said.\n\n     The Whitewing partnership was financed with $1.4 billion in\nbonds sold last year. The partnership used some of the proceeds to\nbuy Enron power plants and plans to retire the debt by selling\nthem, officials said on the conference call. Other company\npartnerships operate with the same strategy.\n\n     ``Some investors are worried the asset sales won't cover the\nfull amount (borrowed), and Enron will have to furnish support to\nthe detriment of shareholders,'' said Commerzbank analyst Meade.\n\n                      Commercial Paper Rates\n\n     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until\nOct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies\nwith the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not on\ncredit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for a\npossible downgrade.\n\n     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-\nterm debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above\ninvestment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's rate the\ncompany's debt at investment grade.\n\n     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and\nadvice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the\ncompany on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-\nfired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, along\nwith J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion\nloan.\n\n\n\nHow Enron Blew It\nTexas Monthly\nNovember 2001\n\nLess than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=\ney, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=\nst important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=\narish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?\n\nby Mimi Swartz <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.p=\nhp>\n=20\nTHE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=\ne international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=\n way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=\nompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=\nernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=\nrown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=\nhey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=\norm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=\nblic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=\ng intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=\nsize TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=\ntors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=\nople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=\npped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=\ns; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=\ninated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=\nting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=\nlevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: \"From the World's =\nLeading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!\"\n\nFor a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=\nm a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=\n. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=\ncent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=\nlion to $100 billion. \"The very mention of the company in energy circles th=\nroughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,\"=\n notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=\nrket intelligence to the energy business.\n\nThis Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=\nd to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=\ny then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =\nformula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =\nselling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=\nmpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=\n to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=\nnron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=\nation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=\nou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =\npower needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =\nnew and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=\nck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=\nhe company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=\nrld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=\neded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, \"was a great mar=\nriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=\nntality of the financial markets.\"\n\nThe Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=\nd of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=\n was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=\nan economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =\nculture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=\nhe best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=\no could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=\n the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=\n company couldn't possibly go wrong.\n\nOr could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =\n$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=\nrgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=\n his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=\nject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=\n, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=\nnce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=\nnge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=\ntain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=\nt the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.\n\nENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD \"a totally different way of thinking about b=\nusiness-we got it.\" At Enron, in fact, you either \"got it\" or you were gone=\n-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=\ne color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =\nonce headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=\nny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=\n off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=\nlack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=\nble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=\nling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=\nt six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=\nral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=\nrica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=\nhained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, \"someone cou=\nld actually get killed.\" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=\nistmas morning. \"I had no idea what I'd let go of,\" Skilling says of all th=\ne personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20\n\nFrom a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=\n photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=\nf working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=\ned, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=\ner. He almost missed his brother's wedding. \"Learning a foreign language-I =\nnever learned a foreign language!\" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=\ngest son to school. \"I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=\nen-minute scheduling.\" Travel: \"You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=\nnything out of it!\" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =\non his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. \"I'm not sure=\n that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,\" he says, finally=\n. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=\ns pragmatic edge. \"It would have been easy to stay,\" he says. \"But that wou=\nld not have been good for me.\"=20\n\nHe's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=\nsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=\nduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=\n underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=\neporters who have labeled his resignation \"bizarre\" and associates who are =\nbitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=\nits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=\n upon. \"I'm surprised,\" he says, \"that people have so much trouble understa=\nnding this.\"\n\nPEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=\nneties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=\nlding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=\no five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=\nine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=\nked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=\n hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=\nse days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=\nat scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =\nin Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=\n the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=\nuch humiliation?\n\nBut this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=\nes when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=\nas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=\nntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=\nolatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=\nral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=\ny gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=\n from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=\ns then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=\no chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=\ntoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=\nietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=\ndly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=\nNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=\ne of Texas.\n\nHNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=\nmpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =\npipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=\nn the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=\n in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =\nCoastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled \"the purchase\" was being call=\ned \"the merger\" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=\nly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=\navity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=\nnning a new company called Enron. \"Over time it became clear that Lay had a=\n better vision of the future,\" says one person associated with Enron at tha=\nt time. \"He never fought change. He embraced change.\"\n\nLay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=\n debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =\nexclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =\nnew business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=\ntarted.=20\n\nLIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=\nd spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=\nad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=\nllinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) \"I l=\niked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,\" he told Busines=\nsWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =\nwasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =\nwas anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=\nhat he would come to call \"intellectual capital.\" He loved being smart, and=\n he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=\nodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=\nk on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=\ns class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=\nup path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =\na business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20\n\nIt is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=\n, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=\n all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=\nying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=\none saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=\nhere credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=\n called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=\ne price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =\na broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =\nrisk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=\nestment bank would.\n\nSkilling worked up some numbers and found them \"absolutely compelling.\" The=\nn the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=\nutives. He had a one-page presentation. \"Almost to a person,\" Skilling says=\n, \"they thought it was stupid.\" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=\nected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=\nen said, \"Let's go.\"\n\nThe Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=\n cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=\nns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=\nse divides that seem to define his life: \"I believed this whole world would=\n be different, a huge breakthrough\" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =\neven if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=\n, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =\ncharacter, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=\n joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, \"We were in=\n.\" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=\non as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=\nr him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=\n. After that, says Skilling, \"we never looked back.\"\n\nSkilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=\nd a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=\nould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =\ngas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=\nate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=\nest access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =\nto be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=\netter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=\nake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=\nrice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=\nth startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =\nhave ever imagined.\n\nTHIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=\nade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=\ness. The idea was to build a \"knowledge-based business,\" which demanded a s=\nkill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=\nt were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=\nf them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=\n industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=\nolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =\nmoney-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. \"Enron was going to=\n create a niche for itself or die,\" one former executive explains. \"The peo=\nple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=\nrrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.\"\nSkilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=\nmartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=\ncause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =\nwanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=\ngest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=\noston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be \"a=\nggressive.\" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=\nere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20\nYou could see what he was looking for on \"Super Saturdays\" at the Houston h=\neadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=\nn-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=\n day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=\nbility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called \"a sense =\nof urgency.\" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =\ncandidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=\nhe types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =\nEnron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=\nybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =\nthan enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=\nts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=\ng suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)\nFor the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=\nnd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=\nturing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=\nlobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=\npany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=\n with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=\ne house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=\non never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=\nld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=\nerweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=\nm. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=\nen at night. \"They were so cutting edge,\" rhapsodizes someone involved with=\n the company health care program at the time. \"They really thought about th=\ne psychology and what it took to keep these people going.\"\nSkilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=\n, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=\ne titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=\nnd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=\nes-with no cap. \"If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=\n make a lot of money,\" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=\ntil resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=\nision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =\nwith two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=\n. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=\ned him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=\nf-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=\nectacular Mexican villa. \"Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=\nd say,\" one loyalist says.=20\nAnd why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=\nerchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=\nuzzword was \"aggressive,\" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=\nved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=\n Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=\nice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=\nn barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=\nny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=\nrvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=\ne somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=\nrts).\nBut the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=\nade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =\nthe division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=\ngest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=\nn had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=\n2 billion to $7 billion. \"Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=\n in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,\" the New =\nYork Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=\ning had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=\nsforming another.\n\"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,\"=\n sang the New York Times in 1999. \"In the staid world of regulated utilitie=\ns and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,\" crowed For=\ntune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=\ne, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=\n, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=\ncover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=\nel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=\n client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=\ne against the usual winter downturn?\nBut most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=\nommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=\ncame another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=\nnline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=\nd price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=\non, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=\ny lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=\nng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=\nt the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=\n deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=\n in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. \"Its strat=\negy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=\ndities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,\" BusinessWeek insis=\nted.\nThere was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =\nthe company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=\nustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=\nomers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=\no come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=\nents as customers and began calling them \"counterparties.\"\nSkilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=\naximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=\n overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=\ne quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=\nl-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=\nderwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=\nets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=\n, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=\nd at all.=20\nWhile many businesses used what was known in the industry as \"mark-to-marke=\nt accounting,\" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=\nompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=\n idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=\nt deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=\nnuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=\never many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=\n went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=\nht be something fishy about what they called \"subjective accounting,\" inves=\ntors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=\net fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=\nt that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =\ngoing to be high enough. \"Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,\" =\nsays one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=\nany could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=\n for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=\nontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=\nting literacy charity: \"Even the person who was supposed to give money away=\n for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,\" he says.\nAs Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =\ntook on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=\nron family put it, \"It became a company full of mercenaries.\" The change st=\narted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =\nof the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=\nhe commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=\nrhearing orders like \"I need a smart person-go buy me one\" or \"Buy me an in=\ntelligent slave, quick.\" Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=\ne sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=\nrody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=\no disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.\nAnd, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=\n. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=\nkilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=\nystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=\nhose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=\nickly became \"rank and yank.\") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=\nsion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=\niate put it, \"Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=\n store.\" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=\nn's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=\nitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=\ne, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=\non higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=\n he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=\nore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.\nEveryone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =\n\"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=\night of the future,\" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=\nals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=\nps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=\nn as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase \"No old tapes\" became a=\nn Enron clich?. \"People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,\" says=\n one former Enron executive.\nIn such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=\nictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=\n E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=\ne for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =\nbut they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=\ns way: \"They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=\nou bleed to death.\"\nBEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =\ncompany into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=\nust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=\nts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=\nlt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=\nealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=\non's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=\nojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=\nous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. \"It wasn't the tim=\ne for long-term approaches,\" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=\n \"It was the technology era.\"\nTo rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=\ncca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=\nars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=\nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=\ne requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=\nron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =\n$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=\nf Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=\ne Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =\ntwo appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=\nrate America.\nBut then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=\na, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=\nay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=\nercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=\nhanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=\ner Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=\n, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.\nForcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=\nns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=\ng lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=\ntless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=\ng a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=\n deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=\nifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=\ns smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=\n visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=\nster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=\nk her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =\nEnron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=\nlity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=\nvatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=\nst water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=\ner sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20\nBut Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =\nbusiness fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=\nke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=\n it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=\nd confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =\nout at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=\n diminished, was folded into Enron. \"I think it's best for Rebecca to start=\n afresh,\" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=\n Or as one critic put it, \"They were more interested in destroying the old =\nculture than running a business.\"=20\nAs 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=\n announced the inevitable: \"The best time for the succession to occur is wh=\nen the company is doing well,\" he told the press. \"Enron is doing extremely=\n well now.\" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.\nALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=\npower market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=\nle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=\nhe company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=\nay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=\ne W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=\nod or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =\nanthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=\n the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=\nornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=\nried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=\neregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=\n was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=\naknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=\n January.\nWithin Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =\nIndia plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =\nconstant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=\ntion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=\nat the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =\nand never properly managed those it had. \"For three months Gray Davis did a=\n very good job of blaming us,\" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=\nrate communications. \"We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=\nte House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=\ngest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=\nare of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis.\" (Californi=\na utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=\n be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=\nl too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=\nke comparing California with the Titanic. (\"At least the Titanic went down =\nwith its lights on.\")\nBut the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =\nbeen responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=\n believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=\n it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=\n buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=\non in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=\nid the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=\ne in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=\nrket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=\n Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.\nSkilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=\nhe stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=\nuring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=\nlenged Enron's financial reporting an \"asshole.\" When the company reported =\nhefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=\ns had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=\nts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=\nomised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. \"Th=\nere wasn't any positive news,\" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=\now. \"Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.\"\nThe business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=\nd in March whether Enron was overpriced. (\"Start with a pretty straightforw=\nard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?\") The routine cashing =\nin of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=\ned in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=\nay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=\nnal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=\nin the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=\ne failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=\ne stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=\nnally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. \"When Wall Stre=\net is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=\n\" says Carol Coale. \"When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=\nrry more weight.\"\nThis fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=\nxperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =\nthe most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=\nretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=\neir ways. \"It just created an attitude,\" one executive still at Enron says.=\n \"If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=\nere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'\"=20\nLoyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=\n now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=\np duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. \"But,\" as=\n one Houston oilman explains, \"if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=\nh someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=\non that's better suited for good times than bad.\"\nAs it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=\nck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=\n and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=\nes killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=\nm, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =\na new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=\n, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =\neverything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but \"innovat=\ne much closer to our core.\" As for the culture: \"Things like the Performanc=\ne Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=\ngorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=\nrale problem.\"\nThat Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=\n of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=\n their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=\nth Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=\nved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=\nen the company was in trouble, it was different. \"Even Jeff's biggest detra=\nctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,\" one loyalist admits.\nBut on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. \"Look,\" he s=\nays with finality, \"ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=\nerests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.\"\nFree of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=\nelf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=\nnologies. \"The first wave never gets it right,\" he says. \"The stand-alone d=\not-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=\nd wave that will change the world.\" Houston, he promises, will become the w=\norld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=\nact, he is already shopping for office space.\n\"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,\" he says, almost breathless. =\n\"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=\net it.\"\n\n\n\nEnron Fails to Smooth Things Over\nBy Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>\nSenior Columnist\nTheStreet.com\n10/23/2001 01:07 PM EDT\nURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002864.html>\n\nEnron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) held a special conference call Tuesday=\n to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock.=20\nBut worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and=\n the CEO publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off-balance=\n sheet transaction.=20\nThe transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex=\n financing that Enron entered into with a partnership called LJM2, which wa=\ns led by Enron's finance chief Andrew Fastow. Terminating this arrangement =\nled to a $1.2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter. Monday, Enron =\nstock plunged 20% after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commis=\nsion is probing \"related party transactions.\" Executives declined to respon=\nd to questions about Fastow's role in the LJM2 partnership on the Tuesday c=\nall.=20\nAnother key issue is the impact of the equity reduction. The company said o=\nn the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth q=\nuarter, due to the termination of the LJM2 financing. But CEO Ken Lay said =\nthe company wouldn't be increasing its earnings guidance of $1.80 a share f=\nor 2001 and $2.15 for 2002.=20\nWhen a share count drops, earnings per share should normally increase, assu=\nming the earnings number stays constant. The 60 million shares are equivale=\nnt to about 6.5% of the company's diluted total in the third quarter. As a =\nresult, Enron should have raised its per-share profits forecast by about th=\nat much, assuming constant earnings.=20\nWhen asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing, =\nCEO Lay replied that the company had previously increased its guidance for =\nthis year. He then affirmed the 2002 number.=20\nNow, to be fair, Enron may not be forecasting lower earnings. The planned r=\neduction in shares may simply bring the total share count back close to a l=\nevel in the fourth quarter and 2002 that analysts had originally expected. =\nNotably, the share count in the third quarter jumped by 20 million, meaning=\n a fourth-quarter reduction might not change matters that much. Alternative=\nly, Enron may beat fourth-quarter estimates by 6.5%; perhaps the company ha=\ns simply chosen not to increase guidance at this stage, given uncertainties=\n in the economy. In any case, more clarity on this matter is clearly needed=\n.=20\nCalls to Enron weren't immediately returned. The stock edged up 2% Tuesday =\nafter falling nearly 40% since last week amid worries about complex off-bal=\nance sheet deals.=20\nThe call, arranged after Enron's Monday plunge, contained a lot of queries =\nabout two trusts, called Marlin II and Whitewing, against which Enron borro=\nwed some $3.4 billion. Lay became testy after questioning by Richard Grubma=\nn of Boston-based hedge fund Highfields Capital Management. Grubman, who wa=\ns called an \"a--hole\" by Enron's former CEO Jeff Skilling on an April confe=\nrence call, was trying to find out the value of water assets held by Marlin=\n II. The optimal way of paying back money borrowed through the trust is to =\nsell the water assets.=20\nGrubman's line of questioning implied that the Marlin assets were worth onl=\ny about $100 million, meaning Enron would have to find about $900 million t=\no pay off the Marlin II-related debt. Grubman arrived at $100 million after=\n factoring in what he saw as the effects of a third-quarter writedown to wa=\nter assets, some of which are included in Marlin II.=20\nLay disputed the $100 million number. At one point, he accused Grubman of d=\nriving Enron's stock down and monopolizing the Tuesday conference call. In =\nthe middle of Grubman's comments, Lay told the call operator to go to the n=\next caller.=20\nGrubman didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.=20\nIf Enron has to find $900 million, this can be done by issuing stock or rai=\nsing cash on its balance sheet. If the latter route is taken, Enron says it=\n's likely to use asset sales to generate the cash. Enron executives said li=\nquidity would be sufficient and detailed at least $3.35 billion in availabl=\ne credit lines.=20\nBut if Enron's debt-to-capital ratio exceeds 65%, the covenants on some of =\nthose lines are broken. After the $1.2 billion equity writedown and other c=\nharges taken in the third quarter, that ratio is probably about 50%-55% (En=\nron hasn't released a third-quarter balance sheet to arrive at an exact cal=\nculation). It would take $3 billion in further writedowns or charges to pus=\nh Enron's debt-to-capital ratio up to 65%.=20\n\nStocks=20\nMore Static For Enron=20\nForbes.com staff, Forbes.com\n10.23.01, 11:15 AM ET=20\n\nNEW YORK - Enron scrambled again to reassure investors this morning, after =\nit disclosed yesterday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had=\n asked for information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andre=\nw Fastow and other executives.=20\n\nEnron (nyse: ENE ) last week reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million =\nafter taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments.

Enron remains one\nof Wall Street's most highly rated stocks, even after the largest\nenergy trader acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run\nby its chief financial officer led to a writedown of $1.2 billion\nin shareholder equity.\n\n     Lay wasn't so successful with investors, who have abandoned\nEnron shares, slashing their value 42 percent in a week.\n\n     ``You've got a lot of people lining up to say the emperor has\nno clothes,'' said Richard Gross of Lehman Brothers Inc., who\ntoday repeated his ``strong buy'' rating on Enron. Analysts at\nCredit Suisse First Boston, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and other firms\nhave also kept their highest ratings on Enron.\n\n     Gross still likes the look of Enron's finery. ``The core\nfranchise here is very valuable,'' he said, and the stock's\ndecline more than reflects the ``worst case'' for the company.\n\n     In Boston and at similar meetings in Houston and New York,\nLay had to explain the unwinding of the partnerships. He and other\nEnron executives assured investors the company has no more\nsurprises in store, according to Greg Phelps, who manages $1.1\nbillion at John Hancock Advisers Inc., and attended the Boston\nsession.\n\n     The partnerships functioned somewhat like private equity\nfunds, according to analysts and investors, and included\ninvestments that lost money. The Securities and Exchange\nCommission has asked for more information about them, Enron said\nyesterday.\n\n                        One Hold, One Sell\n\n     While two analysts have cut their Enron ratings after\nlearning about the partnerships, they only dented the company's\npopularity on Wall Street.\n\n     Michael Heim of A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis lowered\nhis rating to ``hold'' from ``buy'' on Friday. He said he has been\nlooking for discussion of the partnerships in Enron's SEC filings\nand is only seeing ``vague references'' that don't leave him with\na ``good comfort level.''\n\n     With Heim's rating change, Enron went from being the second\nmost highly rated stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to the\n10th, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.\n\n     Today, Zach Wagner at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis cut\nEnron to ``reduce'' from ``accumulate.'' Ratings by Edward Jones,\nwhich caters to individual investors rather than institutions,\naren't tracked by First Call.\n\n     First Call translates analyst ratings into numbers, with\n``strong buy'' a one, ``buy'' a two, and so on, then averages the\nratings to rank a company's Wall Street popularity. The most\nhighly rated stock is Tyco International Ltd., which has fallen 12\npercent this year.\n\n     Enron shares fell 86 cents to $19.79 today.\n\n                        Remaining Skeptical\n\n     However highly brokerage analysts rate the stock, ``I have to\nremain skeptical,'' said Barry Borak, energy analyst at David L.\nBabson & Co., which manages $60 billion in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts.\n\n     ``There's been a huge loss of management credibility at\nEnron,'' Borak said, because of the partnerships and the\nunexpected departure in August of Jeffrey Skilling, who had held\nthe post of chief executive officer for six months and was heir\napparent to Lay. ``Nobody I've talked to thinks (Skilling's\ndeparture) is for personal reasons,'' Borak said.\n\n     Skilling helped transform Enron from a gas pipeline company\ninto the biggest energy trading company. Enron also owns power\nplants in deregulated markets.\n\n     Borak said Babson doesn't own Enron shares and won't be a\nbuyer ``until I can get better, more thorough information about\nwhat else might pop up in the future.''\n\n     Borak and other investors said Enron has a reputation for not\nproviding enough information about its businesses, and they said\nthis makes the positive view of the company on Wall Street more\ndifficult to understand.\n\n     After Skilling resigned, Lay said the company would be more\nopen about its businesses. A bullet point in his talk in Boston\nwas ``increased transparency of financial and operating results,''\naccording to a handout provided at the Boston meeting.\n\n                         Amazed, Dismayed\n\n     Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale wrote in a\nnote to clients last week that she was ``amazed at the willingness\nof Enron's management to break out earnings and expenses to the\ndegree that it disclosed in the third quarter.''\n\n     Coale also wrote that she was ``dismayed by the apparent\n`disguise' of the additional $1.2 billion equity hit that was not\ndisclosed in (Enron's) press release and was briefly mentioned in\nthe earnings conference call.'' Coale kept her rating on Enron at\n``buy.''\n\n     Phelps at John Hancock said that his ``cynical side''\nbelieves that investment banking business has helped keep Wall\nStreet recommending Enron stock. ``They provide some good\nunderwriting business,'' he said.\n\n     Credit Suisse First Boston managed a secondary sale of 12\nmillion Enron shares in 1999, with Lehman Brothers acting\nas co-manager. Credit Suisse has also managed bond sales for\nEnron this year.\n\n\n\nEnron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)\n2001-10-23 16:38 (New York)\n\nEnron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)\n\n     (Updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph.)\n\n     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest\nenergy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 million\nloan, ensuring access to credit if the company is cut off from\nmoney markets, say people familiar with the matter.\n\n     Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company\nsaid the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its\nfinances. The company depends on a $3 billion commercial paper, or\nshort-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations.\n\n     Moody's Investors Service last week placed all $13 billion of\nthe company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible\ndowngrade. Any drop in the rating may cut off Enron from the\ncommercial paper market, raising the costs of short-term debt.\n\n     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to both\nthe capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's Chief\nFinancial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.\nHe said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,\ngiving it enough cash to operate normally.\n\n     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,\ndeclined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, also\nwouldn't comment.\n\n     Shares of Enron, based in Houston, fell 86 cents to $19.79.\nThey have fallen 76 percent this year.\n\n                         Complex Financing\n\n     An investor sued Enron last week, saying dealings with two\npartnerships run by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,\ncost the company $35 million. The suit also calls Fastow's\nleadership of the partnerships, set up to remove debt from Enron's\nbooks, a conflict of interest.\n\n     Enron bought back 62 million shares to unwind positions in\nsome partnerships run by Fastow, said Chief Executive Officer Ken\nLay on the conference call with investors today.\n\n     The number of shares differs from a Wall Street Journal\nreport on Thursday that said Enron had bought back 55 million\nshares. The buyback reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion,\nthe Journal said.\n\n     The company set up the partnerships and other affiliated\ncompanies to buy Enron assets such as power plants. The\npartnerships allow Enron to take debt off its books, letting it\nborrow to invest in its main business of commodities trading,\nEnron said. Enron trades electricity, natural gas, oil, coal and\nother commodities.\n\n     ```They have complex off-balance sheet financing,'' said\nCommerzbank analyst Andre Mead. ``It's difficult to ascertain the\nfull impact on shareholders.''\n\n     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated\ncompanies headed by Fastow. The company has at least $3 billion in\nsuch ``off-the-books'' financing in affiliated companies, Ray\nNiles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to\ninvestors.\n\n                      Depends on Asset Sales\n\n     One partnership, Whitewing Management, owns 250,000 preferred\nshares that Enron may have to convert to common stock. Whitewing\npartners can demand their preferred shares be converted if Enron\ncommon stock falls below a certain price or if Enron's credit\nrating drops under investment grade.\n\n     Whitewing and other Enron partnerships and trusts include\ncompany executives as officers and directors, according to records\nfrom the Texas secretary of state.\n\n     ``Over the life of these trust structures, Enron has in fact\nissued a sizable amount of equity,'' Enron Treasurer Ben Gilsan\nsaid. Most of that was shares issued to Enron executives as part\nof a deferred compensation plan, Gilsan said.\n\n     The Whitewing partnership was financed with $1.4 billion in\nbonds sold last year. The partnership used some of the proceeds to\nbuy Enron power plants and plans to retire the debt by selling\nthem, officials said on the conference call. Other company\npartnerships operate with the same strategy.\n\n     ``Some investors are worried the asset sales won't cover the\nfull amount (borrowed), and Enron will have to furnish support to\nthe detriment of shareholders,'' said Commerzbank analyst Meade.\n\n                      Commercial Paper Rates\n\n     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until\nOct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies\nwith the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not on\ncredit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for a\npossible downgrade.\n\n     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-\nterm debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above\ninvestment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's rate the\ncompany's debt at investment grade.\n\n     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and\nadvice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the\ncompany on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-\nfired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, along\nwith J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion\nloan.\n\n\n\nHow Enron Blew It\nTexas Monthly\nNovember 2001\n\nLess than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=\ney, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=\nst important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=\narish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?\n\nby Mimi Swartz <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.p=\nhp>\n=20\nTHE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=\ne international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=\n way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=\nompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=\nernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=\nrown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=\nhey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=\norm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=\nblic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=\ng intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=\nsize TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=\ntors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=\nople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=\npped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=\ns; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=\ninated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=\nting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=\nlevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: \"From the World's =\nLeading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!\"\n\nFor a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=\nm a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=\n. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=\ncent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=\nlion to $100 billion. \"The very mention of the company in energy circles th=\nroughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,\"=\n notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=\nrket intelligence to the energy business.\n\nThis Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=\nd to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=\ny then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =\nformula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =\nselling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=\nmpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=\n to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=\nnron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=\nation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=\nou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =\npower needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =\nnew and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=\nck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=\nhe company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=\nrld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=\neded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, \"was a great mar=\nriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=\nntality of the financial markets.\"\n\nThe Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=\nd of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=\n was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=\nan economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =\nculture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=\nhe best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=\no could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=\n the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=\n company couldn't possibly go wrong.\n\nOr could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =\n$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=\nrgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=\n his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=\nject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=\n, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=\nnce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=\nnge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=\ntain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=\nt the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.\n\nENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD \"a totally different way of thinking about b=\nusiness-we got it.\" At Enron, in fact, you either \"got it\" or you were gone=\n-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=\ne color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =\nonce headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=\nny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=\n off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=\nlack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=\nble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=\nling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=\nt six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=\nral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=\nrica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=\nhained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, \"someone cou=\nld actually get killed.\" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=\nistmas morning. \"I had no idea what I'd let go of,\" Skilling says of all th=\ne personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20\n\nFrom a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=\n photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=\nf working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=\ned, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=\ner. He almost missed his brother's wedding. \"Learning a foreign language-I =\nnever learned a foreign language!\" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=\ngest son to school. \"I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=\nen-minute scheduling.\" Travel: \"You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=\nnything out of it!\" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =\non his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. \"I'm not sure=\n that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,\" he says, finally=\n. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=\ns pragmatic edge. \"It would have been easy to stay,\" he says. \"But that wou=\nld not have been good for me.\"=20\n\nHe's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=\nsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=\nduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=\n underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=\neporters who have labeled his resignation \"bizarre\" and associates who are =\nbitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=\nits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=\n upon. \"I'm surprised,\" he says, \"that people have so much trouble understa=\nnding this.\"\n\nPEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=\nneties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=\nlding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=\no five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=\nine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=\nked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=\n hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=\nse days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=\nat scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =\nin Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=\n the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=\nuch humiliation?\n\nBut this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=\nes when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=\nas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=\nntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=\nolatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=\nral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=\ny gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=\n from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=\ns then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=\no chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=\ntoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=\nietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=\ndly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=\nNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=\ne of Texas.\n\nHNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=\nmpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =\npipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=\nn the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=\n in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =\nCoastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled \"the purchase\" was being call=\ned \"the merger\" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=\nly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=\navity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=\nnning a new company called Enron. \"Over time it became clear that Lay had a=\n better vision of the future,\" says one person associated with Enron at tha=\nt time. \"He never fought change. He embraced change.\"\n\nLay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=\n debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =\nexclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =\nnew business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=\ntarted.=20\n\nLIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=\nd spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=\nad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=\nllinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) \"I l=\niked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,\" he told Busines=\nsWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =\nwasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =\nwas anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=\nhat he would come to call \"intellectual capital.\" He loved being smart, and=\n he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=\nodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=\nk on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=\ns class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=\nup path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =\na business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20\n\nIt is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=\n, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=\n all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=\nying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=\none saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=\nhere credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=\n called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=\ne price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =\na broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =\nrisk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=\nestment bank would.\n\nSkilling worked up some numbers and found them \"absolutely compelling.\" The=\nn the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=\nutives. He had a one-page presentation. \"Almost to a person,\" Skilling says=\n, \"they thought it was stupid.\" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=\nected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=\nen said, \"Let's go.\"\n\nThe Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=\n cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=\nns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=\nse divides that seem to define his life: \"I believed this whole world would=\n be different, a huge breakthrough\" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =\neven if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=\n, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =\ncharacter, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=\n joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, \"We were in=\n.\" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=\non as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=\nr him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=\n. After that, says Skilling, \"we never looked back.\"\n\nSkilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=\nd a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=\nould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =\ngas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=\nate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=\nest access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =\nto be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=\netter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=\nake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=\nrice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=\nth startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =\nhave ever imagined.\n\nTHIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=\nade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=\ness. The idea was to build a \"knowledge-based business,\" which demanded a s=\nkill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=\nt were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=\nf them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=\n industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=\nolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =\nmoney-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. \"Enron was going to=\n create a niche for itself or die,\" one former executive explains. \"The peo=\nple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=\nrrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.\"\nSkilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=\nmartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=\ncause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =\nwanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=\ngest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=\noston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be \"a=\nggressive.\" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=\nere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20\nYou could see what he was looking for on \"Super Saturdays\" at the Houston h=\neadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=\nn-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=\n day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=\nbility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called \"a sense =\nof urgency.\" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =\ncandidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=\nhe types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =\nEnron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=\nybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =\nthan enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=\nts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=\ng suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)\nFor the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=\nnd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=\nturing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=\nlobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=\npany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=\n with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=\ne house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=\non never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=\nld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=\nerweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=\nm. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=\nen at night. \"They were so cutting edge,\" rhapsodizes someone involved with=\n the company health care program at the time. \"They really thought about th=\ne psychology and what it took to keep these people going.\"\nSkilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=\n, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=\ne titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=\nnd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=\nes-with no cap. \"If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=\n make a lot of money,\" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=\ntil resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=\nision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =\nwith two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=\n. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=\ned him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=\nf-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=\nectacular Mexican villa. \"Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=\nd say,\" one loyalist says.=20\nAnd why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=\nerchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=\nuzzword was \"aggressive,\" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=\nved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=\n Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=\nice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=\nn barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=\nny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=\nrvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=\ne somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=\nrts).\nBut the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=\nade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =\nthe division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=\ngest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=\nn had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=\n2 billion to $7 billion. \"Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=\n in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,\" the New =\nYork Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=\ning had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=\nsforming another.\n\"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,\"=\n sang the New York Times in 1999. \"In the staid world of regulated utilitie=\ns and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,\" crowed For=\ntune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=\ne, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=\n, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=\ncover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=\nel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=\n client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=\ne against the usual winter downturn?\nBut most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=\nommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=\ncame another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=\nnline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=\nd price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=\non, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=\ny lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=\nng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=\nt the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=\n deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=\n in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. \"Its strat=\negy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=\ndities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,\" BusinessWeek insis=\nted.\nThere was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =\nthe company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=\nustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=\nomers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=\no come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=\nents as customers and began calling them \"counterparties.\"\nSkilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=\naximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=\n overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=\ne quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=\nl-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=\nderwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=\nets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=\n, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=\nd at all.=20\nWhile many businesses used what was known in the industry as \"mark-to-marke=\nt accounting,\" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=\nompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=\n idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=\nt deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=\nnuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=\never many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=\n went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=\nht be something fishy about what they called \"subjective accounting,\" inves=\ntors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=\net fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=\nt that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =\ngoing to be high enough. \"Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,\" =\nsays one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=\nany could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=\n for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=\nontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=\nting literacy charity: \"Even the person who was supposed to give money away=\n for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,\" he says.\nAs Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =\ntook on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=\nron family put it, \"It became a company full of mercenaries.\" The change st=\narted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =\nof the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=\nhe commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=\nrhearing orders like \"I need a smart person-go buy me one\" or \"Buy me an in=\ntelligent slave, quick.\" Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=\ne sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=\nrody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=\no disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.\nAnd, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=\n. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=\nkilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=\nystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=\nhose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=\nickly became \"rank and yank.\") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=\nsion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=\niate put it, \"Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=\n store.\" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=\nn's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=\nitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=\ne, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=\non higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=\n he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=\nore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.\nEveryone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =\n\"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=\night of the future,\" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=\nals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=\nps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=\nn as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase \"No old tapes\" became a=\nn Enron clich?. \"People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,\" says=\n one former Enron executive.\nIn such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=\nictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=\n E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=\ne for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =\nbut they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=\ns way: \"They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=\nou bleed to death.\"\nBEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =\ncompany into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=\nust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=\nts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=\nlt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=\nealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=\non's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=\nojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=\nous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. \"It wasn't the tim=\ne for long-term approaches,\" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=\n \"It was the technology era.\"\nTo rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=\ncca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=\nars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=\nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=\ne requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=\nron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =\n$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=\nf Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=\ne Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =\ntwo appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=\nrate America.\nBut then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=\na, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=\nay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=\nercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=\nhanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=\ner Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=\n, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.\nForcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=\nns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=\ng lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=\ntless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=\ng a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=\n deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=\nifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=\ns smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=\n visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=\nster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=\nk her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =\nEnron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=\nlity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=\nvatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=\nst water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=\ner sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20\nBut Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =\nbusiness fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=\nke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=\n it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=\nd confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =\nout at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=\n diminished, was folded into Enron. \"I think it's best for Rebecca to start=\n afresh,\" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=\n Or as one critic put it, \"They were more interested in destroying the old =\nculture than running a business.\"=20\nAs 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=\n announced the inevitable: \"The best time for the succession to occur is wh=\nen the company is doing well,\" he told the press. \"Enron is doing extremely=\n well now.\" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.\nALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=\npower market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=\nle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=\nhe company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=\nay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=\ne W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=\nod or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =\nanthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=\n the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=\nornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=\nried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=\neregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=\n was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=\naknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=\n January.\nWithin Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =\nIndia plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =\nconstant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=\ntion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=\nat the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =\nand never properly managed those it had. \"For three months Gray Davis did a=\n very good job of blaming us,\" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=\nrate communications. \"We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=\nte House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=\ngest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=\nare of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis.\" (Californi=\na utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=\n be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=\nl too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=\nke comparing California with the Titanic. (\"At least the Titanic went down =\nwith its lights on.\")\nBut the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =\nbeen responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=\n believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=\n it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=\n buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=\non in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=\nid the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=\ne in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=\nrket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=\n Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.\nSkilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=\nhe stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=\nuring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=\nlenged Enron's financial reporting an \"asshole.\" When the company reported =\nhefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=\ns had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=\nts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=\nomised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. \"Th=\nere wasn't any positive news,\" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=\now. \"Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.\"\nThe business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=\nd in March whether Enron was overpriced. (\"Start with a pretty straightforw=\nard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?\") The routine cashing =\nin of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=\ned in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=\nay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=\nnal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=\nin the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=\ne failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=\ne stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=\nnally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. \"When Wall Stre=\net is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=\n\" says Carol Coale. \"When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=\nrry more weight.\"\nThis fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=\nxperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =\nthe most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=\nretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=\neir ways. \"It just created an attitude,\" one executive still at Enron says.=\n \"If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=\nere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'\"=20\nLoyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=\n now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=\np duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. \"But,\" as=\n one Houston oilman explains, \"if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=\nh someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=\non that's better suited for good times than bad.\"\nAs it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=\nck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=\n and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=\nes killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=\nm, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =\na new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=\n, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =\neverything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but \"innovat=\ne much closer to our core.\" As for the culture: \"Things like the Performanc=\ne Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=\ngorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=\nrale problem.\"\nThat Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=\n of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=\n their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=\nth Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=\nved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=\nen the company was in trouble, it was different. \"Even Jeff's biggest detra=\nctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,\" one loyalist admits.\nBut on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. \"Look,\" he s=\nays with finality, \"ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=\nerests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.\"\nFree of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=\nelf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=\nnologies. \"The first wave never gets it right,\" he says. \"The stand-alone d=\not-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=\nd wave that will change the world.\" Houston, he promises, will become the w=\norld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=\nact, he is already shopping for office space.\n\"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,\" he says, almost breathless. =\n\"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=\net it.\"\n\n\n\nEnron Fails to Smooth Things Over\nBy Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>\nSenior Columnist\nTheStreet.com\n10/23/2001 01:07 PM EDT\nURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002864.html>\n\nEnron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) held a special conference call Tuesday=\n to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock.=20\nBut worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and=\n the CEO publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off-balance=\n sheet transaction.=20\nThe transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex=\n financing that Enron entered into with a partnership called LJM2, which wa=\ns led by Enron's finance chief Andrew Fastow. Terminating this arrangement =\nled to a $1.2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter. Monday, Enron =\nstock plunged 20% after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commis=\nsion is probing \"related party transactions.\" Executives declined to respon=\nd to questions about Fastow's role in the LJM2 partnership on the Tuesday c=\nall.=20\nAnother key issue is the impact of the equity reduction. The company said o=\nn the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth q=\nuarter, due to the termination of the LJM2 financing. But CEO Ken Lay said =\nthe company wouldn't be increasing its earnings guidance of $1.80 a share f=\nor 2001 and $2.15 for 2002.=20\nWhen a share count drops, earnings per share should normally increase, assu=\nming the earnings number stays constant. The 60 million shares are equivale=\nnt to about 6.5% of the company's diluted total in the third quarter. As a =\nresult, Enron should have raised its per-share profits forecast by about th=\nat much, assuming constant earnings.=20\nWhen asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing, =\nCEO Lay replied that the company had previously increased its guidance for =\nthis year. He then affirmed the 2002 number.=20\nNow, to be fair, Enron may not be forecasting lower earnings. The planned r=\neduction in shares may simply bring the total share count back close to a l=\nevel in the fourth quarter and 2002 that analysts had originally expected. =\nNotably, the share count in the third quarter jumped by 20 million, meaning=\n a fourth-quarter reduction might not change matters that much. Alternative=\nly, Enron may beat fourth-quarter estimates by 6.5%; perhaps the company ha=\ns simply chosen not to increase guidance at this stage, given uncertainties=\n in the economy. In any case, more clarity on this matter is clearly needed=\n.=20\nCalls to Enron weren't immediately returned. The stock edged up 2% Tuesday =\nafter falling nearly 40% since last week amid worries about complex off-bal=\nance sheet deals.=20\nThe call, arranged after Enron's Monday plunge, contained a lot of queries =\nabout two trusts, called Marlin II and Whitewing, against which Enron borro=\nwed some $3.4 billion. Lay became testy after questioning by Richard Grubma=\nn of Boston-based hedge fund Highfields Capital Management. Grubman, who wa=\ns called an \"a--hole\" by Enron's former CEO Jeff Skilling on an April confe=\nrence call, was trying to find out the value of water assets held by Marlin=\n II. The optimal way of paying back money borrowed through the trust is to =\nsell the water assets.=20\nGrubman's line of questioning implied that the Marlin assets were worth onl=\ny about $100 million, meaning Enron would have to find about $900 million t=\no pay off the Marlin II-related debt. Grubman arrived at $100 million after=\n factoring in what he saw as the effects of a third-quarter writedown to wa=\nter assets, some of which are included in Marlin II.=20\nLay disputed the $100 million number. At one point, he accused Grubman of d=\nriving Enron's stock down and monopolizing the Tuesday conference call. In =\nthe middle of Grubman's comments, Lay told the call operator to go to the n=\next caller.=20\nGrubman didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.=20\nIf Enron has to find $900 million, this can be done by issuing stock or rai=\nsing cash on its balance sheet. If the latter route is taken, Enron says it=\n's likely to use asset sales to generate the cash. Enron executives said li=\nquidity would be sufficient and detailed at least $3.35 billion in availabl=\ne credit lines.=20\nBut if Enron's debt-to-capital ratio exceeds 65%, the covenants on some of =\nthose lines are broken. After the $1.2 billion equity writedown and other c=\nharges taken in the third quarter, that ratio is probably about 50%-55% (En=\nron hasn't released a third-quarter balance sheet to arrive at an exact cal=\nculation). It would take $3 billion in further writedowns or charges to pus=\nh Enron's debt-to-capital ratio up to 65%.=20\n\nStocks=20\nMore Static For Enron=20\nForbes.com staff, Forbes.com\n10.23.01, 11:15 AM ET=20\n\nNEW YORK - Enron scrambled again to reassure investors this morning, after =\nit disclosed yesterday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had=\n asked for information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andre=\nw Fastow and other executives.=20\n\nEnron (nyse: ENE ) last week reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million =\nafter taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments.
