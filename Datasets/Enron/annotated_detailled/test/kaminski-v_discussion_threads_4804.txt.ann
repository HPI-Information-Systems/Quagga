Carriers\nhave been leasing capacity from each other for decades and ISPs have\nbeen setting up private peering connections with each other for\nseveral years, so the concept of using each other's bandwidth is not\nnew.\n\nBut Enron has set up a system that's based primarily on Lucent network\nmanagement gear, which Enron claims will allow it to do two important\nthings: Guarantee performance over multiple net-works; and change\ncircuits in a matter of seconds, as opposed to days or months.\n\nToday, when carriers buy capacity from each other, they ink deals that\nsometimes span 20 years. But Enron plans on changing that. The\ncompany's idea is to treat bandwidth as a commodity. Instead of\nsigning a 20-year deal, the carrier signs up with carrier ABC because\nit is offering a competitively low rate on T-3 connections for that\nmonth. But next month carrier XYZ is expected to lower its rates, so\nthe carrier then switches its circuits from ABC to XYZ.\n\nEnron has the capability to change circuits every five seconds, says Tom\nGros, vice president of global trading at Enron. So the idea is that\ncarriers are going to be able to get high-quality bandwidth at reduced\nrates. Nothing wrong with that idea, but a few questions come up.\n\nOne: Will your carrier or ISP share those savings with you, the business\ncustomer? Well, that's hard to say. This is a difficult question to\nanswer because most Enron's \"intermediation\" partner deals are\nconfidential. Global Crossings, a wholesale carrier, is the only deal\nthat's been announced because it was Enron's first.\n\nSo chances are you won't even know if your carrier is working with\nEnron, who claims several other carriers are in fact working with\nthem.\n\nTwo: Doesn't constant circuit changes bring up monitoring issues for\nbusiness users? Gros says it should not, and in fact end users should\nexpect even better monitoring capabilities. Now while En-ron very well\nmight provide its carrier and ISP partners with high-end monitoring\ntools, I would take the position that it's highly unlikely that\ncarriers are going to make those tools available to their cus-tomers.\nWhy? Well the answer gets back to the first issue. If all of the deals\nare confidential, end us-ers aren't going to even know their circuits\nare getting switched around.\n\nWould you want to know if your carrier or ISP is participating in\nbandwidth trading?\n\nTo contact Denise Pappalardo:\n-----------------------------\nDenise Pappalardo is a senior editor for Network World, covering ISPs,\nVPNs and related topics.
