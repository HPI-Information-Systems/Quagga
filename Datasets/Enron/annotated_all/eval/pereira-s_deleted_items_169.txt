   To abstain from; to do without.

     This  one  has given up smoking today, I knew; that one his
     weekly  visit  to the cafe, another will forgo her favorite
     foods.
     --Joanne Harris, [1]Chocolat

     If  my  deepest  wish is to sit on a beach in Maine fishing
     for  bass,  I  might  cheerfully  forgo  stock  options  in
     Microsoft to do it.
     --Alan  Ryan,  "It's  Not  Easy  Being  Equal," [2]New York
     Times, June 18, 2000

     As  much  as I wanted to forgo college and head straight to
     New  York  to  become  an  actress, my father said that all
     knowledge  would serve me and that the more I knew the more
     I could bring to my work.
     --Jane Alexander, Command Performance
     _________________________________________________________

   Forgo  derives  from  Old  English  forgan, "to go without, to
   forgo," from for-, "without" + gan, "to go."
