B>Rick,

B>Attached is a listing of various incremental Phase II l/c's which we recently 
B>put together as part of the selldown.  The first table highlights the two 
B>l/c's which the sponsors have committed to.  Enron would have to pick up 
B>either 65% of these (if we can get MSEB to pick up their 15% share) or 80%.  
B>The other l/c's in the second table are solely the responsibility of DPC.  It 
B>would be up to the sponsors to decide to what extent they want to help 
B>support these.  Let's discuss if your numbers are different from these.
