RE: Tax Refunds

 The amount of your payment is based on the taxable income shown on your
 2000 return. The amount is 5% of your taxable income up to a maximum of
 $300 for a single taxpayer, $500 for head of household and $600 for a
 married couple filing jointly. If your tax liability after nonrefundable
 credits is less than these maximum amounts, your limit is the smaller of
 this amount or 5% of your taxable income. If you did not have a tax
 liability for 2000 but do have one for 2001, you may be able to claim the
 tax credit on your 2001 return.

 This means for those of you who made at least $6000 in taxable income
 last year (2000), you will receive $300 back on the date scheduled below:
