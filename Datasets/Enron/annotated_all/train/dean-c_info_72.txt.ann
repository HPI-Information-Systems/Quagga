O. Box 26530, Austin, Texas 78755 -\n Phone=\n =20\n 512-795-8536\n\n UT Baseball Team in Regional; Football Recruiting Picking Up Steam\n\n The slumping Longhorn baseball team made the 64-team NCAA Touarnment\n field,=20\n getting a No. 3 seed in a sub-regional at Stanford.\n The Longhorns, 34-24 overall after going 0-2 despite a No. 3 seed in the\n Big=\n =20\n 12 Tournament, also got a No. 3 seed in the Palo Alto tourney. The\n Longhorns=\n =20\n will play No. 2 seed Long Beach State (35-21) in a first-round game Friday\n =20\n at 5 p. m. Texas time (3 p.m. Pacific time) in the double-elimination=20\n tournament.\n Stanford, the top seed at 42-14, will play No. 4 seed Marisa (32-19) in\n the=20\n other first round game Friday.\n The first-round losers will play an elimination game at 1 p.m. Texas\n time=20\n Saturday, with the first-round winners meeting at 5 p.m. Texas time. At\n that=\n =20\n point, one team will be 2-0 and will advance to the finals. The other\n two=20\n surivivors will be 1-1 and will play an elimination game at 9 p.m. Texas\n tim=\n e=20\n Saturday.\n The Saturday night survivor will meet the unbeaten team at 3 p.m. Texas\n time=\n =20\n Sunday. If the unbeaten team  wins, the tourney is over. If it loses, the\n tw=\n o=20\n teams will meet again at 7 p.m. Sunday for the title.\n The 16 survivors of the sub-regionals will meet in two-team super\n regionals=20\n June 1-3 at sites to be determined. All of the super regionals will be\n best=20\n two out of three series.\n Suspended pitcher Albert Montes has rejoined the team after missing the\n Big=20\n 12 tourney.\n Big 12 champion Nebraska is seeded No. 1 and is hosting a sub regional.\n Texa=\n s=20\n Tech is a No. 3 seed at Cal State Fullerton. Oklahoma State is a No. 3\n seed=20\n at a sub regional at Tulane. Baylor is a No. 4 seed at Rice, which is\n seeded=\n =20\n No. 1 in its regional.\n * * * *\n Basketball coach Rick Barnes apparently has no plans to add another\n recruit=20\n in the wake of junior forward Maurice Evans' surprising decision to hire\n an=20\n agent, which makes him ineligible to return for his senior year. Evans\n had=20\n said earlier he was going to make himself available for the NBA draft,\n but=20\n Barnes and everyone else expected him to return. By hiring an agent, he\n made=\n =20\n that impossible.\n Evans is a good college player, but, at 6-5, he is not an accomplished=20\n dribbler and there are no 6-5 guys in the NBA who are not accomplished=20\n dribblers. I don't know what he will be doing next basketball season, but\n I=20\n will be shocked if he is playing in the NBA.\n * * * *\n The Longhorn football coaches have wrapped up four weeks of travel and\n talen=\n t=20\n evaluation, and now they are zeroing in on the top prospects they have\n found=\n .\n There are a lot of kids who already are well known, but four players\n really=20\n shot to the top of many college lists during the evaluation period. They\n are=\n =20\n CB Michael Hawkins, 6-1, 180, 4.4, and LB-DE Glenn Jackson, 6-2, 220,\n 4.6,=20\n both of Carrollton Turner; OL Tony Ugoh, 6-4, 275, 5.1, of Spring\n Westfield,=\n =20\n and LB-DE Nick Owino, 6-2, 225, 4.6, of Alief Elsik. UT is one of the\n many=20\n schools in hot pursuit of this talented quartet.\n Owino is the lightning quick DE the Longhorns have been searching for\n ever=20\n since this staff arrived and Jackson is lightning quick, too, and might\n wind=\n =20\n up at DE, too.\n I'm not saying they are Tony Brackens, but they have great potential\n and=20\n could develop into that type of player.\n Both head coach Mack Brown and defensive coordinator Carl Reese have\n been=20\n eager to sign some good speed rushers to play DE, and, after studying tape\n o=\n f=20\n both Owino and Jackson, I think they are just what the Longhorns have\n been=20\n seeking.\n The first Longhorn summer camps will start June 2. Some of the top\n recruits=20\n who plan to make one of the early June camps are DTs Earl Anderson of\n San=20\n Marcos and Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale, Arizona, and  CB Donald Burgs\n of=20\n Houston Madison. Sendlein and Burgs are both strong Longhorn leans and\n might=\n =20\n commit early. Anderson also likes the Longhorns, but has said he\n probably=20\n won't commit early.\n LB Andy Matakis of Corpus Christi Flour Bluff is an interesting recruit.\n He=20\n came to Texas as a heralded player from Pennsylvania, but did not have\n a=20\n great season last year, his first in Texas. But he came from a state\n where=20\n below-the-waist blocking is not allowed in high school, and it will be=20\n interesting to see what he does this year after getting accustomed to\n having=\n =20\n people diving at his knees. He is big and fast at 6-3, 225 and 4.6, and\n migh=\n t=20\n blossom into a big-time prospect.\n * * * *\n My next e-mail/fax will be whenever events warrant.\n * * * *\n The True Orange Fax Service includes  at  least  99 fax/e-mails  a year\n and=20\n costs $99 ($79 by E-Mail).
