B>FYI. This is a presentation/outline that these two ENW guys are putting 
B>together for the group. They will want Legal's appropriate input into aspects 
B>of these materials.
B>
B>Also, I had copied and circulated to each of you today a State Bar of 
B>Texas-sponsored seminar that is being held later this week (Thurs-Fri) at the 
B>Westchase Hilton on E-Commerce Legal Topics. It's cheap ($250) and appears 
B>quite topical for each of us.

B>Gentlemen,
B>Attached is a general PPT document detailing the overall strategy for 
B>attacking verticals.
B>The second document is a broad perspective piece on a specific vertical which 
B>is a 
B>good representation for the type of work we are looking at doing going 
B>forward.
B>
B>Note:  In the second document, the risk-sharing SPV is illustrative only and 
B>does not 
B>likely represent what we will do on a broader basis.
B>
B>Feel free to call me with any questions.  Again, all of this is work in 
B>process.   I will circulate 
B>any and all items that will help with your understanding of our endeavors so 
B>that our group
B>best works together.
