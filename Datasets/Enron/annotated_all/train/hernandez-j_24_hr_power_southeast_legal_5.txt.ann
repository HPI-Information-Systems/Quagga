Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=\nistiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=\nral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=\nota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=\nmpany.\n\n=20\n\n\nGeneral Observations\n\n\n=20\n\nThe Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=\nte in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=\nhe commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=\n all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =\nmuch discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=\nd very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=\nrward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=\nward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=\nt some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=\no be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=\niscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=\n reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=\nble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=\nanizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20\n\n=20\n\n\nFERC Deliverables\n\n\nA great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=\neded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =\nfelt was critical. =20\n\nThe first major topic was \"How many RTOs?  What is their scope?\"  All panel=\nists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=\ny FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=\nge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.\n\nThe next topic was, \"What will be standard market design?\"  Panelists varie=\nd on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=\nor one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=\nndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=\nfollowed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=\nnt situation.\n\nThe commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=\nt the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=\n throughout their discussions, asking questions like, \"Do we need to issue =\na Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?\" and, \"How much detail do you=\n need us to provide?\"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =\nwanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=\no say FERC should \"Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=\n little further.\"  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=\nt in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=\nhe need for cautious investigation. =20\n\nOne item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=\nheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=\ne \"RTO Design and RTO Implementation\" section would address many of the que=\nstions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=\nos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =\na course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=\nction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =\nquestions:\n\n\n?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=\nr, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=\ns nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=\n be others that must be accommodated?\n\n\n?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=\nedule (\"covered\" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=\ning from congestion charges (both \"covered\" and \"uncovered\" schedules are a=\nllowed)?=20\n\n\n?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =\nservices appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=\n to be addressed?\n\n\n?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=\nior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=\nre those contracts?  Are there other solutions?\n\n\n?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=\n Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=\n, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=\ndules), or will they be required at all?\n\n\n?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =\nin standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=\n services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=\nncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?\n\n\n?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =\n Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=\nss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=\nly unwieldy?\n\n\n?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=\nd into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =\nnon-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=\nreat each NJE as a separate entity?\n\n\nHopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=\nl questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =\nto move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=\n, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., \"do congestion management\") will t=\nake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., \"LMP with financi=\nal hedging instruments\") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =\nabout moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =\nto move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.\n\nNow for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=\nred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=\non of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=\n said, \"My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =\nbelieve that that statement is true.\"  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=\nhat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=\nion by the Northwest interests was false.\n\n\nNERC and GISB\n\n\nA great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=\ntting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, \"Are we looking at a bea=\nuty contest between NERC and GISB?\"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=\nl short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=\ninually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=\nly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=\nSB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the \"new\" structure of NERC and=\n did not focus on its history.\n\nBrownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=\nsking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=\n they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=\nble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=\ng of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=\nt, Brownell.\n\nMennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=\nan.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=\ned \"successes,\" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =\nlikely remember that these \"successes\" have not been so successful, resulti=\nng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=\n in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=\n the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.\n\nThere was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=\n, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =\ntalk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.\n\nThe arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=\nged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=\nrship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=\nomewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=\n say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\n\nAndy Rodriquez\nRegulatory Affairs - Enron Corp.\nandy.rodriquez@enron.com\n713-345-3771=20\n\n",
