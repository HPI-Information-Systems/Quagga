Subject: Getting into the Holiday Spirit!




Good morning everyone:

Several of us were talking and in order to help us get into the 
"Holiday Spirit" we thought it would be nice if each of us brought 
an appetizer, dessert, chips, popcorn, etc. or anything you desire, 
next Monday, the 18th.  We will put everything out in one of the 
conference rooms and celebrate ALL DAY!  Never mind about the 
calories - this is a once-a-year thing!  

This is not mandatory - just if you want to and if you remember!

Also, don't forget the "Holiday Party" at Damians on Tuesday night 
5:30 - 7:30 PM.

Have a great day!

Shirley
