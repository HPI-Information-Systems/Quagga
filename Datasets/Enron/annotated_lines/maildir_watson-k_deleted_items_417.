B>What drives the value of a publicly-held company ? Revenue growth?  Market share?  
B>Profitability?  Over the past 12 ? 18 months it seems that the financial markets have 
B>been focusing more on profitability as the main measure of corporate value.  But do 
B>today?s financial statements really reflect the true value of a company? 
B>
B>Please join us for this free one-hour webcast, sponsored by Hyperion, which will focus 
B>on techniques for developing Value-Focused Financial Strategies.  Featured on the 
B>agenda will be Dr. Robert Howell, visiting professor at Dartmouth?s Tuck School of 
B>Business, who will suggest how financial reporting can be significantly improved so that 
B>investors, creditors and other stakeholders may find them more useful in making rational 
B>investment, credit and similar decisions.  Dr. Howell will elaborate on his views about 
B>driving business value based on ?free cash flow? ? views which have been published in 
B>a series of articles in Fortune Magazine.   Then hear from Hyperion how a unified 
B>approach to Financial Management can enable improved financial reporting, enhanced 
B>decision-making and the implementation of value-focused financial strategies.
B>
B>Your questions will be answered during a live, interactive, Q&A session, giving you 
B>the opportunity to make specific inquiries pertaining to your organization.
