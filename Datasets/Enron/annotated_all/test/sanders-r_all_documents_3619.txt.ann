  "text": "On Tues. 9/21 I met with Phil Zirngibl, the Alliance manager for Ft. James.  \nI informed him Enron wanted the original $10mm back.  It was our belief that  \nFJ did not act in good faith in \"expeditiously and fairly evaluating\" all of \nEnron's energy proposals.  Phil argued that Enron saw substantial revenue \nfrom the commodity (gas & coal) deals that were executed.  I argued that \ncommodity deals were never the \"intent\" of the Alliance as outlined in the \n\"Objectives of the Parties.\"  I told him we didn't need an Alliance agreement \nto do commodity deals.\n\nPhil was only prepared to argue the definition of \"substantial assets\" as it \nrelated to the asset sale.  I told him Kalamazoo was substantial to us \nbecause that was where we had a significant energy project.  It was also \nsubstantial because the mill was ranked in the top 3 in terms of natural gas \nconsumption.  FJ let us work on the Kzoo project for 9 months before \ninforming us the mill would be sold.  I told Phil this is not how Alliance \npartners treat each other. \nI asked Phil if he was prepared to offer any proposal to resolve the \nsituation.  His response was FJ was happy with the Alliance and wanted to \ncontinue with it \"as is.\"  My response was that was not acceptable to Enron.\n\nI told him the list of potential mediators for the dispute was being sent to \ntheir counsel Greg Chaffee.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI think we need to pick out a couple of strong project examples to use in our \ncase to present to the mediator.  Rather than just show the list of potential \ndeals Enron pitched and the lost opportunity value, I think a stronger case \nto get our original $10mm back is to say here are 3 examples, here is the \nvalue to both parties, and FJ still did not do the project (or they chose to \ndo it themselves).  This should go a long way to proving \"bad faith\".  \n\nI will get with David Barr and start assembling this information along with \nthe entire project list and the various \"reasons\" FJ chose not to do the \nprojects.\n\nBased on this initial meeting, if the parties can't resolve the dispute \nwithin 30 days, the dispute goes to non-binding mediation.  The parties are \nto meet with the mediator within 21 days of the dispute being referred to the \nmediator.  Per the Alliance agreement, the mediation meeting should take \nplace anytime between now and November 10.\n\nLet me know if you have questions.\n",
