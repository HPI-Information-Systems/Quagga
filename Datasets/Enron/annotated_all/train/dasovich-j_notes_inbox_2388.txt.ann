  "text": "Commentary: Things Get Even Worse in  California\nAlthough it hardly seems possible, the California  wholesale electric market \nis getting worse. And rapidly. Power prices are high  across the board and \nthe California Independent System Operator has taken to  declaring \nsimultaneous stage one and stage two emergencies every morning, right  along \nwith brewing the morning coffee.\nOn Thursday afternoon, the ISO  declared the first stage three emergency, \nalthough it was not necessary to  implement rolling blackouts. Demand hit \n31,600 MW during the day, far from a  peak for the state. But planned and \nunplanned outages meant that the statewide  capacity margin was a bare 1,000 \nMW.\nThe chief culprit appears to be the  state's price caps, which are driving \ngeneration out of the state, and the  politicians appear poised to make \nmatters worse. The caps combine with soaring  natural gas prices to drive \nelectricity out of the California market. Because of  gas prices in the $7 \nper million Btu range, the price caps are simply not  enforceable. They are, \nin short, a joke.\nWith price caps of $250/MWh in place  through the California Power Exchange, \nand with bids hitting the caps for every  hour of the market, generators are \nfleeing the state. That's because prices in  the Pacific Northwest are \nrunning in the neighborhood of $375/MWh, and  generators are selling into \nOregon and Washington instead of California.\nDow  Jones reports that utilities in the Northwest last week showed up as \nbuyers in  the Cal PX, buying power at $400/MWh -- $250/MWh for the juice and \n$150/MWh for  transportation. \nJust how wacky has the California market become? In order to  protect \nreliability, the Cal ISO has been quietly purchasing power in bilateral  \ndeals from out-of-state generators at prices above the cap. The price cap \nrules  apparently allow the ISO to buy above the cap if needed to supply an \nemergency.  But it can only buy from out-of-state companies, not the \nCalifornia  generators.\nLast Wednesday, the ISO paid some $10 million to buy 1,000 MW --  most likely \nfrom BC Hydro, although the ISO isn't talking -- or about $900/MWh.  Los \nAngeles Department of Water and Power, sitting in the catbird seat with  \nexcess capacity, sold the ISO some 1,200 MW at the capped rate of $250/MWh. \nA  civil suit charges that LADWP has been -- shock! -- profiteering by \nselling its  low-cost juice from Bonneville Power Administration into the \nCalifornia market  at an order of magnitude above what it paid.\nHow are the state's politicians  responding? They don't seem to understand \nthe short-term consequences of what is  going on. They are talking about \nbanning exports of power made in California  (can you say \"Commerce \nClause\"?), or forming a state power agency (not in this  decade), or \nre-regulating the utilities (ditto).\nThere is only one action  that California can take to protect itself against \nblackouts this winter. The  state must get rid of the price caps entirely. \nImmediately.\nCalifornia's  choice is simple and stark. Does the state want to ensure that \nits citizens have  not enough power at an artificially low price, or enough \npower at a politically  unpopular high price? The need for power trumps the \nprice issue.",
