Glenn Hubbard\n>\n>Washington Post\n>Friday, November 16, 2001; Page A47\n>\n>\n>With most indicators of economic production, such as employment and \n>purchasing, showing further decline in October, some have argued that \n>President Bush's growth plan would have little stimulative effect. They \n>prefer the Senate Democrats' plan, on the grounds that spending is a better \n>way to revive the economy.\n>\n>Permit me to differ. The president's plan, included in the stimulus plan \n>passed by the House, addresses the nation's underlying economic problems. \n>If enacted, the tax cuts will quickly deliver a boost to move the economy \n>back toward its long-run growth path. The plan, it is estimated, would \n>result in 300,000 more jobs and add half a percentage point to the 2002 \n>growth rate.\n>\n>Here's how tax cuts help stimulate the economy. Tax cuts for individuals \n>give them more money to spend and invest. Tax cuts for business for three \n>years -- long enough to have a serious effect -- would make investment less \n>expensive, so businesses would be encouraged to buy equipment, increase \n>production and expand employment.\n>\n>It is a major fallacy to praise new spending plans as \"stimulus.\" This \n>ignores the fact that a dollar spent by the government is one fewer that \n>can be spent by private businesses. Furthermore, new spending programs \n>almost never go away, and they lead to more inflexible regulation of the \n>economy. New spending programs are not only unlikely to make the economy \n>grow, they also are an undesirable response to terrorism risks.\n>\n>Instead, it is important to take advantage of the flexibility and \n>innovation of the private sector. This will reduce the negative effects on \n>job growth as part of our necessary response to terrorism.\n>\n>The real underlying economic problem is that the terrorist attacks took a \n>direct toll on the economy and, more important, on the confidence of \n>American households and firms. The combined effect tipped a fragile rate of \n>economic growth into negative territory. But the attacks did not undermine \n>long-term productivity growth, so economic fundamentals remain strong.\n>\n>The challenge is simply to restore the health of the economy quickly. And \n>Congress needs to do so in the way that will be most beneficial. Assistance \n>for dislocated workers is important, and the president has already proposed \n>an aggressive package to provide it. But spending should not be confused \n>with economic stimulus.\n>\n>The basic source of uncertainty and loss of consumer confidence is fear \n>over job loss, and the fact is that additional spending, even on \n>unemployment insurance won't give people jobs. Indeed, the excessive \n>expansion of unemployment insurance proposed by the Senate would actually \n>increase unemployment, because it would discourage job applicants from \n>accepting new positions. Moreover, the Senate bill would err by raising \n>taxes on employers -- exactly the wrong thing to do at this moment.\n>\n>Until one addresses the underlying source of the uncertainty, there will be \n>no guarantee that hemorrhaging federal dollars will do any good. Lower tax \n>rates are the best way to create jobs and make large and small businesses \n>grow. Acceleration of future tax cuts, which Congress has already chosen, \n>will help the economy.\n>\n>Despite the repeated claim that only poor households will spend additional \n>income, evidence indicates almost all households spend about the same \n>percentage of their tax cuts. Business tax relief is essential because it \n>encourages firms to expand investment and employment. With tax cuts, firms \n>would be able to replace existing machines with more productive ones, \n>precisely the kind of change that frees up funds to hire more workers.\n>\n>The economy needs help now. The president wants to create more jobs, while \n>the Senate proposes new entitlements. If you were unemployed, which would \n>you prefer?\n>\n>The writer is chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.\n>\n>(Reprinted by permission of the author)\n>\n>************************************************\n>\n>Paid for by the Republican National Committee.\n>\n>If you wish to unsubscribe from this newsletter, simply click here:\n>http://mail.echampions2000.com/GoNow/a14064a31344a56465125a0\n>\n>To subscribe to this newsletter, please click here:\n>http://www.gopteamleader.com/signup.asp\n>\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp",
