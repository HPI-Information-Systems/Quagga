Today's focus: Super-secret Linux

By Phil Hochmuth

Network Associates is teaming up with the National Security Agency,
the government's top electronic cryptography and spying institution,
to help the agency fine-tune its highly secure version of Linux. The
goal is to create a version of Linux that is impervious to outside
attacks.

Security Enhanced Linux, or SELinux, is a project under development
by the NSA to create a version of the operating system that is more
secure than the commercial distributions of Linux available from
software vendors and the open-source community. The PGP Security
division of Network Associates is working with the NSA to modify the
Linux source code so that applications running on a Linux server or
PC have reduced access to a Linux machine's underlying operating
system. The aim is to give Linux servers the ability to shirk off
"buffer overrun" and "format string" attacks, which take advantage of
loose ends in Linux applications to access a server's core operating
system and shut it down. A Linux worm dubbed "Lion" was recently
identified as using this method to hack Linux servers.

NSA has worked with other software firms to shore up other weaknesses
in the operating system. Secure Computing has worked on the SELinux
project to add its Type Enforcement technology to SELinux. Type
Enforcement protects the operating system and applications by
segmenting them into security "domains" with specifications on what
types of files can be accessed by each domain. (For example, this
could be used to prevent access to a configuration file through an
application, such as Apache Web server). NSA is also working with
VMWare to come up with a more secure user permissions system for
allowing users with different security access to work on the same
server.

The good news for Linux users who are not high-level NSA operatives
is that SELinux will be released to the open-source community once
finished. This means that commercial Linux vendors could include
SELinux security enhancements in future releases, resulting in more
bulletproof Linux Web and database servers in enterprises.
