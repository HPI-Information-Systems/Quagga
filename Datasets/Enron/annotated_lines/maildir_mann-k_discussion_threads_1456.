B>Hi there,
B>
B>I made some revisions to the language Rose proposed.
B>
B>Here are some questions/comments:
B>
B>I deleted the references to changing any delegation of rights/obligations. =
B>=20
B>I'm not yet clear as to what the agency language will look like, and what=
B>=20
B>rights we need/want to change (i) the identity of the agent (ii) the role o=
B>f=20
B>the agent (iii) whether the agency can be terminated.  I'm just not that=20
B>familiar with the structure yet, but if I can get that information, I'll wo=
B>rk=20
B>on it.=20
B>
B>I suggest we consider using a credit rating instead of "substantially=20
B>similiar" comparison.  Just easier to decipher.
B>
B>Rose/Lisa, I've added some SPV language.
B>
B>I'm added receipt of final payment as an exception to the credit rating=20
B>standard.  In other words, if they have received their final payment, they=
B>=20
B>can't use credit as a reason to not give consent.
B>
B>I don't think we should agree to provide a list of power projects done by t=
B>he=20
B>assignee in the past 5 years.  I also think 3 years is a bit much on audite=
B>d=20
B>financials, but I didn't comment there.
B>
B>I don't like their language that an affiliate must be intending to=20
B>own/operate the plant.  I've just bracketed the langauge and added=20
B>"construct", since I don't know if this point has already been agreed.
