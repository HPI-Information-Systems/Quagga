B>I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you 
B>could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for 
B>which she is looking.
B>
B>She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA & 
B>HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to 
B>accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is 
B>doing off of HPL's pipe.
B>
B>I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity 
B>on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will 
B>this give me everything that I need?
B>
B>Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in 
B>Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas 
B>on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --  
B>?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?
B>
B>Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some 
B>of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any 
B>ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!
B>
B>Thanks in advance.
