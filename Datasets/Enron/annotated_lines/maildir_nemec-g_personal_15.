B>that I have not been a good friend to you lately.  You deserve to be treated
B>better.  I know I am being totally selfish but at the same time can't seem to
B>stop myself.  I wish I knew of a way to make things between us better.
B>Sometimes I feel like this last three months has just been a dream that I am
B>going to wake up from and everything will be back the way it was before we
B>started drifting apart.  I can't tell you enough how sorry I am for not 
B>talking
B>to you before things got so twisted.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to find 
B>my
B>way back to you now.  I know you find it hard to believe anything I say, but I
B>hope you know that I loved you more than anything when we got married and I
B>still love you even now.  You are a wonderful, caring, beautiful person that I
B>am so very glad to have had in my life.  I will never forget you and will 
B>always
B>have a special place in my heart for you.  This may seem like this is easy for
B>me, but it isn't.  I have just been struggling with this longer than you have.
B>I never wanted this to happen, I wanted to love you for the rest of my life 
B>and
B>make our marriage a priority.  I am sorry I failed you.
B>
B>As far away as it seems now, I hope we can continue to be friends someday.
B>
B>Lisa
