Subject: Weekly Notes

Steve - 

I will be taking this Friday, the 18th, off on vacation.  Here are notes for 
your staff meeting.

Buyer/Seller have executed Offer Letter on Falcon EX ($32,750,000 price).  
Aircraft goes to pre-purchase inspection this weekend.  Close is no later 
than June 6th.  All indications are that buyer is very motivated to complete 
the deal.
Enron Center South (ECS) Project remains solidly on track.  We are 10 weeks 
out on initial occupancy with Level 3 occupancy (EGM moves Aug. 3rd).  Levels 
4 (EIM, ENW, & Credit.Com) occupies two weeks later (Aug. 17).  Level 5 
(Power) occupies two weeks after (Aug. 31st  - Labor Day weekend).  Level 6 
(Gas) occupies two weeks after (Sept. 14th).  Level 7 (Executive) and the 1st 
floor public spaces occupies year end.  Level 2 (Cafeteria) opens Nov.
Found a Law firm interested in Azurix's present space in Three Allen Center 
(3 floors).  Goal is cut deal and have them in by year end.
Enron Broadband indicates an intent to remain on their present ECN floors 
(Levels 44 and 45), plus backfill balance of operations into Wholesale's 
vacated trading floors.  This splits them into two elevator banks and becomes 
problematic for ETS - who wants continuous floors, ECN Levels 39 through 46.
We are seeking subtenants for Broadband's Portland office space.  They plan 
to vacate the Riverplace building by Oct. 
Negotiating new food service contract with Sedexo Marriott to add ECS 
cafeteria.  Total compensation will be based on 3% fee on gross revenue - 
only on individual sales of $2 or more (promote greater # of meals served) 
and bonus based on sharing of net operating income with Enron.  Global 
Sourcing is participating with us in negotiations.
Need to decide if Executive Car Care program is going to be continued (30 
executives participate with employee paying $70 per month and business units 
subsidizing $275 per month).  Decision needed because new Garage will require 
$60K in improvements to get set up for car washing.  Present lease on remote 
car washing facility (@ $5k per month) expired and we are on month to month 
holdover.
We are two weeks out to close on Beltway 8 land deal ($1.7 purchase price).  
Real estate being acquired for construction of new $18 mill. Data Center and 
Disaster Recovery Facility.  Phillipe and I meet with Frevert next week to 
get approvals.

- Bill
