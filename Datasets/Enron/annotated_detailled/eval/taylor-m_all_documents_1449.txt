Please give me a call and we can discuss.  Shari is now definately moving to 
power trading (not public yet) so we really need to figure out how we are 
going to cover all the bases - short and long term.  I will be out the 14th 
through the 17th and plan to be in S.A. the last week in March.  It would be 
grea if we could both be there for the second seminar (looks like the more 
pertinent to our issues) but I hate to think of Carol left all by herself 
that much.  Let's see what we can figure out to make sure everything is 
covered.

Mark:  I have been in touch with Sami Arap who is now Andrea Bertone's boss.  
There are currently two seminars scheduled in Sao Paulo aimed for the 
commercial group and the lawyers as follows:

1.  March 17 - Milbank Tweed  (Securitization)
2.  March 27 - Bracewell (legal issues for contracts)

I think I should attend these and was considering a trip to arrive before the 
start and after the termination of the seminars (approx March 15 - March 
28).  In the interim I could (hopefully) wrap up financial issues with 
Tozzini and address at length physical issues with Tozzini.  Also, I can 
speak with commercial groups and plan a "swap"seminar for the commercial and 
legal groups (date TBD but probably after the legal seminar in San Antonio).  
Please let me know if the timing works for our group in Houston and if you 
have other thoughts.   Hope all is well.  Sara
