B>We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the 
B>possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract 
B>purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to 
B>use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to 
B>change MG's status.
B>
B>Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK 
B>"arranger" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where 
B>the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike 
B>Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical 
B>solutions:
B>
B>1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco 
B>Inc.
B>2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd 
B>(depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two).
B>
B>The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK 
B>and Switzerland.
B>
B>Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If 
B>you need any further information, please let me know.
B>
B>Many thanks.
