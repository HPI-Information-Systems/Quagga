B>Mark,
B>
B>I attach Cadwalader's memorandum in its final version.  This is the product 
B>of a number of discussions/comments between myself and David Mitchell.  It 
B>has been written on the basis that trading is carried on outside the US; 
B>obviously, a different memorandum would be required in relation of trading 
B>carried on by ECT from Houston.
B>
B>Look forward to seeing you on Wednesday, and of course at the Conference!

B>Justin
