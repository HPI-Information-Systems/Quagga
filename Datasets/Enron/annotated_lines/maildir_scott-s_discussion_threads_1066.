B>Dear Recruiting Team Members:
B>
B>I am forwarding a copy of the Enron presentation to each of you for review.  
B>Some of you will be asked to do presentations, many will not.  I just wanted 
B>to send it out to various team members in order to give you an idea of our 
B>marketing strategy and information on campus.  This is simply for your 
B>information.  When this presentation is given, it will include  dates 
B>tailored specifically for each campus based on the dates I have set up 
B>through career services.
B>
B>Have a great day!
