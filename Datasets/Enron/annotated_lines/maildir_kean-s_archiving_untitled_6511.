B>Class Action Lawsuits Alleging Restraint of Trade and Unfair Business 
B>Practices Filed Against SoCal Gas, San Diego Gas & Electric, And El Paso 
B>Natural Gas
B>
B>LOS ANGELES, Dec. 18 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  -
B>Two related class action lawsuits
B>have been filed in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles, against
B>Southern California Gas Company, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company, Sempra
B>Energy (parent of the two utilities), El Paso Natural Gas Co., and other
B>companies related to El Paso Natural Gas.
B>
B>The two lawsuits allege a conspiracy resulting in restraint of trade and
B>unfair competition and unlawful business practices.  The complaints summarize
B>the issue as follows:
B>
B>This action involves a massive conspiracy to eliminate competition in the
B>newly deregulated energy industry that has resulted in endangering
B>California's electrical system and threatening California's economy.  It
B>is perhaps the largest gouging of energy consumers in American history.
B>Southern California's current "energy crisis" is not simply the result of
B>ever-increasing demand by a growing population for energy.  Rather, it is
B>the direct result of a conspiracy among the natural gas industry's most
B>powerful Southern California players to preserve and maintain the market
B>dominance that they enjoyed for many years as monopolies subject to
B>regulation.  When the artificial monopoly created by regulation was
B>disassembled, those dominant companies took prompt and illegal action to
B>ensure that they would not lose the benefits of their market power.  Their
B>unlawful collusion has contributed significantly to the recent
B>astronomical increases in the price of natural gas and electricity.  As a
B>result, Southern California customers have had to pay billions of dollars
B>extra for their natural gas and electric needs.  This lawsuit seeks to
B>recover those damages. (Para. 1 and 2 of complaint.)
B>
B>
B>"In September of 1996, top executives of Southern California Gas Company
B>("SoCal Gas"), San Diego Gas &amp; Electric ("SDG&amp;E") and El Paso Natural 
B>Gas
B>Corporation ("EPNG") met at the Embassy Suites Hotel, near Sky Harbor
B>Airport in Phoenix, Arizona.  Fearing a new era of open competition and
B>lower prices, these latter day captains of industry gathered secretly to
B>hatch a conspiracy to dominate the unregulated aspects of the natural gas
B>and electricity markets.  At the meeting, these three companies, who
B>together dominate the Southern California natural gas market, illegally
B>agreed not to compete against each other in the Southern California and
B>Baja California natural gas delivery markets.  They also conspired to
B>prevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against
B>them and lowered natural gas prices in these markets.  The conspirators
B>sought to eliminate competition, take advantage of electric deregulation,
B>drive up the price of natural gas, and profit from the increased prices."
B>(Para 4 of complaint.)
B>
B>
B>One of the two lawsuits addresses the effects of the conspiracy on natural
B>gas prices; the other deals with the effects on electricity prices.
B>(The price of gas-fired generation establishes the price for most of the
B>electricity used in Southern California.)
B>
B>Copies of the two lawsuits filed this morning are available as Adobe
B>Acrobat (PDF) files on the web site of the law firm of O'Donnell and Shaeffer
B>at http://oslaw.com/osnews.
B>
B>Attorneys representing the plaintiffs are available for interviews, and
B>can also provide additional materials, including copies of the agenda prepared
B>for the secret meeting, as well as graphics illustrating the location of
B>natural gas pipelines that were planned, but then terminated by the defendants
B>following the secret meeting in Phoenix.

B>E SOURCE Study:  Customer-Side Electricity Demand Reduction Could Stem Rising 
B>Power Prices
B>
B>BOULDER, Colo., Dec. 18 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  -
B>With electricity prices rising
B>like floodwaters in California and other states, limited generation capacity
B>has garnered the most attention as the culprit.  Many see constructing new
B>power plants as the sole solution for bringing prices down.  However, E SOURCE
B>research just out of the field indicates that convincing customers to reduce
B>their electricity demand in exchange for cash could provide tremendous price
B>relief in open power markets.  "Our study shows that commercial and industrial
B>customers are very willing to reduce demand if the price is right, if
B>mechanisms are in place for communicating those prices, and if they have a
B>means of controlling their electric loads.  We found that larger customers
B>could offer almost 20 percent of their load as negawatts -- temporary
B>reductions in electricity demand," says E SOURCE Vice President Bill LeBlanc.
B>
B>Because most electricity use is considered essential and rising wholesale
B>prices don't immediately affect end users, prices can go sky high when power
B>supplies get tight.  But if demand dropped in response to high prices, LeBlanc
B>contends that overall power costs would be much lower.  He explains, "Although
B>there's a disconnect between price and demand in the marketplace today, we've
B>uncovered a significant subset of customers who seem ready to participate in a
B>dynamic pricing market.  Unfortunately, most of them don't yet have the
B>communication and control tools that would make load management possible.
B>They also haven't been offered a pricing product they like."  The E SOURCE
B>research study confirms that customers want flexibility in deciding whether to
B>participate in load reductions on a daily or even hourly basis, as just one
B>example.
B>
B>So how many negawatts are available?  According to the E SOURCE national
B>market survey, medium-to-large commercial and industrial customers could
B>potentially reduce their demand by 18 percent if offered a market price of $1
B>per kWh (one of the tested price points) for reduced electricity usage.  At
B>this price -- which, incidentally, is what Edison International CEO and
B>President John Bryson reported that his company paid for electricity on
B>December 12 in wholesale power markets -- about 55,000 MW could be made
B>available across the U.S., and about 4,800 MW in California.  LeBlanc adds,
B>"We can't expect to capture all of this potential.  But with the right
B>product, pricing scheme, and marketing, it would be possible to help relieve
B>price pressure on the whole system."  The E SOURCE study, "Energy Pricing and
B>Load Management:  What Do End-Users Want?" can help energy service providers
B>design appropriate products and identify the customer groups most likely to
B>participate in such programs.  It's based on an extensive research with over
B>700 energy decision-makers across the U.S. and Canada.
