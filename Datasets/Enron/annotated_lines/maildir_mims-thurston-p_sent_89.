B>Hey,
B>
B>I was just getting ready to send you an e-mail and I opened my mail and there 
B>you were.  Things are going okay, the market is down 14 cents so we'll see 
B>where it ends up.  
B>
B>Yes, good news, my dad got out of the hospital yesterday and they called just 
B>as I was leaving for rehearsal and he's doing pretty well.  He still is 
B>extremely tired and has not regained his strength, but Praise God, at least 
B>he's out of the hospital and in good spirits.  I suspect that there is alot 
B>that goes on that they don't tell me, so I really don't know everything.  But 
B>I made them promise to give me things, as they happen.  I'm going down there 
B>next month.  We get President's Day off and I'll be on my way.  Todd wants to 
B>drive, but I don't see the point, when the weather may turn on you in a 
B>heartbeat, and especially with Kendall.  He's drive us crazy!
B>
B>Anyway, we have a three day weekend this week, with Dr.King's birthday, are 
B>you off?  
B>
B>I spoke with Robin last night and she was mainly complaining about her job, 
B>but she's hanging in there.
B>
B>See you later!
