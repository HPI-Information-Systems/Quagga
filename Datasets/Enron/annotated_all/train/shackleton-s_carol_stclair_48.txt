In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T. 
Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes 
Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not 
clearly categorized as "money" but more likely an "account".  Although 
certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including 
"money", "intangibles", which includes "accounts", cannot be perfected by 
possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a 
wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes "money".  Although 
it is not clear, the better view is that "money" means cash in hand and not 
on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate 
to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken 
but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this 
seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely 
unknowingly).     

Accordingly, to perfect the "account" a registration is likely required at 
the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into. 

Even then, as an "account" is an "intangible" certain conflicts rules for 
perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions 
provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the 
jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of 
its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration 
may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance 
search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior 
registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry, 
registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and 
law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.  

Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also 
a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit 
holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.

In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my 
knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has 
recently determined that "money" includes deposits that we are not aware of, 
and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.

Peter.

Peter and Greg:
One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral 
in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash 
collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask 
Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?
