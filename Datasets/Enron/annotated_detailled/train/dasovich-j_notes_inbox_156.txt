Jeff,
As I mentioned in my voice mail message, we met today with a group of 
customers in a workshop format to discuss the options filing, proposed 
amendment and tariff changes.  With the possible exception of one company 
(Amoco), I thought the comments/feedback were mostly positive.  

There seems to be two principal areas of concern with the proposed program:  
(1) the possibility of affiliate abuse by ENA or EES, and (2) the potential 
of a party (ENA, or 3rd party) to exert market power.  Our position going 
into the workshop, and our most likely response going into the FERC 
proceeding, is that Transwestern doesn't want to be put into the position of 
being a "gatekeeper" for these issues, particularly with respect to market 
power.  In addition, we believe there are adequate protections under existing 
FERC policies (Order no. 497) regarding affiliate transactions.  

We have a couple more personal meetings with the utilities in California 
(SoCal and PG&E) to complete prior to moving forward with the filing.  I'm 
planning on going out to California the week of Sept. 11.  I'd love to hook 
up with you while I'm there.  I'll call you with specifics shortly.  

If can answer any questions for you regarding the documents or the program 
itself, please give me a call at ext. 3-1521.
