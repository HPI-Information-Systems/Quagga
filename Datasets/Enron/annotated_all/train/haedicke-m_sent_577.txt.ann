Cain\ne-Journal Number: 8381\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's=20\nuntimely motion for a lineup. An eyewitness testified that she was only an=\n=20\narm's length away from defendant when she saw him \"key\" the complainant's=\n=20\nvehicle, then enter a business. The manager of the business, notified of th=\ne=20\nkeying incident shortly after it occurred, testified that defendant was the=\n=20\nonly person in the building lobby matching the perpetrator's description.=\n=20\nAlthough eyewitness identification was a material issue, a lineup would not=\n=20\nhave resolved any \"mistaken identification\" in this case. The trial court=\n=20\nalso properly considered the untimeliness of the motion, and the possible=\n=20\nhardship a delay for a lineup could have had on the eyewitness, who resided=\n=20\nin another state.

Moss\ne-Journal Number: 8387\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nThe prosecution introduced sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact=\n=20\nto conclude that defendant acted willfully and maliciously, regardless of=\n=20\nwhether he was intoxicated to some degree, when he set fire to the victims'=\n=20\nhome. Even if defendant was drunk when arrested approximately 22 hours afte=\nr=20\nthe fire, his intoxication did not bear any relation to his state of mind o=\nn=20\nthe night of the fire. The testimony indicated that even if defendant was=\n=20\nintoxicated, he remained fully capable of entertaining the necessary specif=\nic=20\nintent. The evidence established that (1) defendant appeared at the victims=\n'=20\nhome three times and was there purposely prior to the fire, (2) defendant h=\nad=20\nno reported difficulty safely traveling to and from the victims' house, (3)=\n=20\ndefendant threatened the victims that he would return to harm them, and (4)=\n=20\ndefendant followed through with the threats later that night when he=20\npurchased kerosene, transported it to the victims' home, poured it onto the=\n=20\nporch and into the mail slot, and set fire to the home.

Pitts\ne-Journal Number: 8395\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nThere was insufficient evidence that defendant performed acts or gave=20\nencouragement that assisted the commission of the crimes to support his=20\nconvictions for aiding and abetting false pretenses and attempted false=20\npretenses. Although defendant threw torn pieces of paper from the passenger=\n=20\ndoor of the vehicle during the pursuit by the police, the credit card numbe=\nrs=20\nrecovered from the torn pieces of paper were not similar to the credit card=\n=20\nnumbers given by defendant's brother to purchase merchandise.

Rose\ne-Journal Number: 8385\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - McDonald, Sawyer, and White\n\nThe trial court erred in suppressing defendant's statements to police on th=\ne=20\nbasis that defendant was in custody and thus entitled to Miranda warnings=\n=20\nfrom the outset of the interview. Defendant agreed to speak with the police=\n,=20\ndrove himself to the station, and was informed prior to the interview that =\nhe=20\nwas not under arrest and was free to leave. At no time was he told that he=\n=20\nwas not free to leave, and the door was left open. The officer's failure to=\n=20\ntell defendant that he was being investigated for CSC did not alter the fac=\nt=20\nthat defendant was told he was free to leave, or render the interview a=20\ncustodial one. Further, under the totality of the circumstances, defendant'=\ns=20\nstatements were knowingly and voluntarily made, and were not the product of=\n=20\npsychological coercion. Defendant was 21-years old, had completed three yea=\nrs=20\nof college, and discerned the focus of the officer's inquiries soon after t=\nhe=20\ninterview began. The trial court's order suppressing defendant's statements=\n=20\nwas reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Prosecutorial misconduct; Other acts evidence; Admission of witness=\n'=20\ntestimony; Jury instructions\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: People v.

The prosecutor did not engage in misconduc=\nt=20\nby eliciting testimony and arguing that the plea agreement required the=20\nwitness to testify truthfully, because the prosecutor did not personally=20\nvouch for the witness' credibility.

Belgiorno\ne-Journal Number: 8389\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Wilder, Smolenski, and Whitbeck\n\nThe trial court erred because it did not conduct an evidentiary hearing=20\nbefore it entered an order modifying the parties' custody. The trial court'=\ns=20\norder placing physical custody of the parties' minor child with=20\nplaintiff-mother was vacated and remanded to (1) conduct an evidentiary=20\nhearing, (2) state specific findings of fact and conclusions of law on the=\n=20\nrecord, (3) determine whether an established custodial environment existed,=\n=20\n(4) determine whether proper cause or a change of circumstances existed tha=\nt=20\njustified a change of custody, and (5) address the best interest factors to=\n=20\ndetermine the best interest of the child.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Termination of parental rights pursuant to oo 19b(3)(a)(ii), (c)(i)=\n,=20\n(g), and (j); Proper service of summons for adjudicative hearing; Failure t=\no=20\nchallenge one of the statutory grounds for termination\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: In re Glover\ne-Journal Number: 8379\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nThe family court did not err in finding that statutory grounds for=20\ntermination of respondent-mother's parental rights were established by clea=\nr=20\nand convincing evidence.

Further=\n,=20\nwhile she was required to seek substance abuse treatment or submit to drug=\n=20\ntesting, she failed to do either.

I=\nt=20\nwas improper for the trial court to inquire into respondent's ability to pa=\ny=20\nchild support under o 51(6)(a) where there was an existing support order. T=\nhe=20\norder that reserved the question of support because respondent was=20\nincarcerated constituted a judicial determination that respondent lacked th=\ne=20\nability to pay. The trial court also erred by failing to appoint counsel fo=\nr=20\nrespondent upon his request because in a stepparent adoption proceeding und=\ner=20\no 51(6)(a), the trial court has discretion to appoint counsel for an indige=\nnt=20\nnonconsenting parent.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nLitigation\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Standing; Case or controversy; Absence of an injury-in-fact;=20\nChallenge to constitutionality of a legalized gambling scheme; Standard of=\n=20\nreview; Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v.

The City of Detroit\ne-Journal Number: 8399\nJudge(s): Nelson, Moore, and Wilhoit\n\nThe district court correctly dismissed plaintiff's suit against both the ci=\nty=20\nand state defendants because plaintiff, an unsuccessful bidder for a licens=\ne=20\nto operate a Detroit casino, lacked standing. The court in Lac Vieux=20\npreviously held that the state law preference exempting certain preferred=\n=20\ndevelopers from the competitive bidding process and allowing a tie-breaking=\n=20\npreference for applicants that had supported the initiative legalizing casi=\nno=20\ngambling in Detroit had been eliminated. Since the preference was=20\nineffective, there could be no injury and no case or controversy against th=\ne=20\nstate defendants in regard to the state statute. As to the city defendants,=\n=20\nthe mayor unequivocally testified that no preference was applied at any sta=\nge=20\nof the competitive selection process until after plaintiff had already been=\n=20\neliminated from the competition.

Cain\ne-Journal Number: 8381\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's=20\nuntimely motion for a lineup. An eyewitness testified that she was only an=\n=20\narm's length away from defendant when she saw him \"key\" the complainant's=\n=20\nvehicle, then enter a business. The manager of the business, notified of th=\ne=20\nkeying incident shortly after it occurred, testified that defendant was the=\n=20\nonly person in the building lobby matching the perpetrator's description.=\n=20\nAlthough eyewitness identification was a material issue, a lineup would not=\n=20\nhave resolved any \"mistaken identification\" in this case. The trial court=\n=20\nalso properly considered the untimeliness of the motion, and the possible=\n=20\nhardship a delay for a lineup could have had on the eyewitness, who resided=\n=20\nin another state.

Moss\ne-Journal Number: 8387\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nThe prosecution introduced sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact=\n=20\nto conclude that defendant acted willfully and maliciously, regardless of=\n=20\nwhether he was intoxicated to some degree, when he set fire to the victims'=\n=20\nhome. Even if defendant was drunk when arrested approximately 22 hours afte=\nr=20\nthe fire, his intoxication did not bear any relation to his state of mind o=\nn=20\nthe night of the fire. The testimony indicated that even if defendant was=\n=20\nintoxicated, he remained fully capable of entertaining the necessary specif=\nic=20\nintent. The evidence established that (1) defendant appeared at the victims=\n'=20\nhome three times and was there purposely prior to the fire, (2) defendant h=\nad=20\nno reported difficulty safely traveling to and from the victims' house, (3)=\n=20\ndefendant threatened the victims that he would return to harm them, and (4)=\n=20\ndefendant followed through with the threats later that night when he=20\npurchased kerosene, transported it to the victims' home, poured it onto the=\n=20\nporch and into the mail slot, and set fire to the home.

Pitts\ne-Journal Number: 8395\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nThere was insufficient evidence that defendant performed acts or gave=20\nencouragement that assisted the commission of the crimes to support his=20\nconvictions for aiding and abetting false pretenses and attempted false=20\npretenses. Although defendant threw torn pieces of paper from the passenger=\n=20\ndoor of the vehicle during the pursuit by the police, the credit card numbe=\nrs=20\nrecovered from the torn pieces of paper were not similar to the credit card=\n=20\nnumbers given by defendant's brother to purchase merchandise.

Rose\ne-Journal Number: 8385\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - McDonald, Sawyer, and White\n\nThe trial court erred in suppressing defendant's statements to police on th=\ne=20\nbasis that defendant was in custody and thus entitled to Miranda warnings=\n=20\nfrom the outset of the interview. Defendant agreed to speak with the police=\n,=20\ndrove himself to the station, and was informed prior to the interview that =\nhe=20\nwas not under arrest and was free to leave. At no time was he told that he=\n=20\nwas not free to leave, and the door was left open. The officer's failure to=\n=20\ntell defendant that he was being investigated for CSC did not alter the fac=\nt=20\nthat defendant was told he was free to leave, or render the interview a=20\ncustodial one. Further, under the totality of the circumstances, defendant'=\ns=20\nstatements were knowingly and voluntarily made, and were not the product of=\n=20\npsychological coercion. Defendant was 21-years old, had completed three yea=\nrs=20\nof college, and discerned the focus of the officer's inquiries soon after t=\nhe=20\ninterview began. The trial court's order suppressing defendant's statements=\n=20\nwas reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Prosecutorial misconduct; Other acts evidence; Admission of witness=\n'=20\ntestimony; Jury instructions\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: People v.

The prosecutor did not engage in misconduc=\nt=20\nby eliciting testimony and arguing that the plea agreement required the=20\nwitness to testify truthfully, because the prosecutor did not personally=20\nvouch for the witness' credibility.

Belgiorno\ne-Journal Number: 8389\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Wilder, Smolenski, and Whitbeck\n\nThe trial court erred because it did not conduct an evidentiary hearing=20\nbefore it entered an order modifying the parties' custody. The trial court'=\ns=20\norder placing physical custody of the parties' minor child with=20\nplaintiff-mother was vacated and remanded to (1) conduct an evidentiary=20\nhearing, (2) state specific findings of fact and conclusions of law on the=\n=20\nrecord, (3) determine whether an established custodial environment existed,=\n=20\n(4) determine whether proper cause or a change of circumstances existed tha=\nt=20\njustified a change of custody, and (5) address the best interest factors to=\n=20\ndetermine the best interest of the child.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Termination of parental rights pursuant to oo 19b(3)(a)(ii), (c)(i)=\n,=20\n(g), and (j); Proper service of summons for adjudicative hearing; Failure t=\no=20\nchallenge one of the statutory grounds for termination\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: In re Glover\ne-Journal Number: 8379\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nThe family court did not err in finding that statutory grounds for=20\ntermination of respondent-mother's parental rights were established by clea=\nr=20\nand convincing evidence. Respondent did not begin to work on her treatment=\n=20\nplan until approximately one month before the termination hearings. Further=\n,=20\nwhile she was required to seek substance abuse treatment or submit to drug=\n=20\ntesting, she failed to do either.

I=\nt=20\nwas improper for the trial court to inquire into respondent's ability to pa=\ny=20\nchild support under o 51(6)(a) where there was an existing support order. T=\nhe=20\norder that reserved the question of support because respondent was=20\nincarcerated constituted a judicial determination that respondent lacked th=\ne=20\nability to pay. The trial court also erred by failing to appoint counsel fo=\nr=20\nrespondent upon his request because in a stepparent adoption proceeding und=\ner=20\no 51(6)(a), the trial court has discretion to appoint counsel for an indige=\nnt=20\nnonconsenting parent.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nLitigation\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Standing; Case or controversy; Absence of an injury-in-fact;=20\nChallenge to constitutionality of a legalized gambling scheme; Standard of=\n=20\nreview; Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v.

The City of Detroit\ne-Journal Number: 8399\nJudge(s): Nelson, Moore, and Wilhoit\n\nThe district court correctly dismissed plaintiff's suit against both the ci=\nty=20\nand state defendants because plaintiff, an unsuccessful bidder for a licens=\ne=20\nto operate a Detroit casino, lacked standing. The court in Lac Vieux=20\npreviously held that the state law preference exempting certain preferred=\n=20\ndevelopers from the competitive bidding process and allowing a tie-breaking=\n=20\npreference for applicants that had supported the initiative legalizing casi=\nno=20\ngambling in Detroit had been eliminated. Since the preference was=20\nineffective, there could be no injury and no case or controversy against th=\ne=20\nstate defendants in regard to the state statute. As to the city defendants,=\n=20\nthe mayor unequivocally testified that no preference was applied at any sta=\nge=20\nof the competitive selection process until after plaintiff had already been=\n=20\neliminated from the competition.
