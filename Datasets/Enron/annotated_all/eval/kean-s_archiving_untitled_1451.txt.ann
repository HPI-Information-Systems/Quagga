  "text": "Duke is holding a news conference at 3pm Central Time.  Call in number is \nbelow. \n\n\nDuke Energy Offers Governor Davis Solutions to California's Power Supply \nShortfall \n\n     Committing to Deliver 3,000 Megawatts of New Supply to California\n               And a Five-Year Fixed Price Supply Contract\n\n    HOUSTON AND MOSS LANDING, Calif., July 31 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy\nNorth America (DENA) today offered to California Governor Gray Davis specific\nsolutions to address the state's electricity supply shortage proposing to\ndeliver 3,000 megawatts of new supply through the construction of generation\nfacilities.  In addition, DENA proposed a five-year, fixed-price supply\ncontract to incumbent utilities to address the immediate concern with volatile\nelectricity prices.\n    \"California's high electricity prices during peak-demand periods result\nfrom insufficient supply to meet the demand,\" said Jim Donnell, president and\nchief executive officer of DENA.  \"In the past ten years, no significant new\npower generation facilities have been built in California.  During the same\nperiod, peak demand has risen more than 10,000 megawatts.  This combination\nhas caused the state's reserve margin to fall to less than 2 percent, which\nnecessarily results in higher prices and abnormal volatility.\"\n    Under current procedures, it takes in excess of four years to deliver new\npower generation in California.  To add substantial incremental generating\ncapacity to California, DENA proposed Governor Davis use his existing\nauthority under the California Emergency Services Act to streamline the\npermitting process to facilitate the rapid construction of environmentally\nfriendly generation by 2001.  DENA also asked the governor to use his current\nauthority to allow California utilities to enter into bilateral contracts with\nenergy providers, so they could better manage their exposure to high energy\nprices.\n    To help solve the state's supply shortfall, DENA said it remained\ncommitted to adding substantial generation in California.  Within two months\nand upon receiving final regulatory approvals, the company will begin\nconstruction on 1,000 megawatts at its Moss Landing facility.  The expansion\nof the current 1,478-megawatt facility will be in commercial operation by\nsummer 2002.  And, with an expedited permitting process, DENA could deploy its\navailable resources to construct an additional 500 megawatts for commercial\noperation in 2001 and 1,500 megawatts for 2002.\n    To address the concern associated with the high energy prices experienced\nthis year, DENA offered to provide up to 2,000 megawatts of electricity to the\nincumbent utilities at $50 per megawatt-hour for a five-year period beginning\nSept. 1, 2000.  This would mitigate the exposure to price spikes, for a\nreasonable time period during which additional generation resources can be\nbuilt.\n    \"DENA is committed to help bring electricity price stability for the\ncitizens of California through these proposals,\" Donnell said.  \"We are\nconfident that our expertise in building and operating power generation\nfacilities can help resolve the supply crisis.\"\n    Duke Energy North America (DENA), is a leading wholesale energy services\ncompany.  DENA, and its affiliates, including Duke Energy Trading and\nMarketing, provides natural gas and power supply and services, and risk\nmanagement products to wholesale energy producers and users.  DENA also\ndevelops, owns and manages a portfolio of merchant generation facilities.\nDENA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy.\n    Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK), a diversified multinational energy company,\ncreates value for customers and shareholders through an integrated network of\nenergy assets and expertise.
