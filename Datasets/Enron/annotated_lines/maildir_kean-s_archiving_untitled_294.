B>I had a hard time logging on remotely, so I just got this now.  As you can 
B>see, it's a relatively brief "overview" presentation for Jeff, not going into 
B>much of the detail surrounding, for example, performance criteria and 
B>evaluation or job classification (where much of the real work remains).  The 
B>main purpose of this presentation is to give Jeff something for the December 
B>Board meeting.
B>
B>I need your thoughts on something: one of the rationales I had discussed with 
B>McKinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for 
B>talent.  A partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity 
B>and reduced hierarchy in an organization.  It also creates substantial upside 
B>opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership.  My 
B>question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes 
B>to attracting and retaining talent.  My suspicion is that our turnover is 
B>farily low, and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the 
B>organization.  Where we run into problems, my gut tells me, is that we have 
B>some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools (ie we often 
B>lose out to the I-Banks and, perhaps McKinsey-level consulting firms) and 
B>that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors 
B>(ie we're OK at the top livels already).  Could you have someone do an 
B>analysis of the turnover rates at different levels?  We may need to weed out 
B>the performance related departures (including those who left after getting a 
B>low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for 
B>performance reasons) if possible.

B>Steve,
B>
B>Attached is a draft of the pack we plan to use in our discussion with Jeff
B>next week.  As you might imagine, we've been going through many iterations
B>of this document, and it is still very much a work-in-process.  Hopefully,
B>you can get a sense of the outline and where we are heading, but the
B>specific points on each page will continue to be wordsmithed.
B>
B>We look forward to getting your reaction/feedback to the structure and
B>overall message.
B>
B>Suzanne asked me to give you her home number, (713) 807-7788, where you can
B>reach her over the weekend.  Otherwise, please feel free to leave a
B>voicemail for either Suzanne (713) 751-4390 or me (214) 665-1754.
B>
B>Thanks,
B>Dan Marcontell
