Can you let me know \nif your approvals reflect otherwise?\n\n2.  With respect to Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company:  \nNorthern Illinois Gas Company should be restyled to be \"Northern Illinois Gas \nCompany d/b/a Nicor Gas Company\".  We have just received the executed ISDA \nMaster with this entity and that is how the counterparty directed us to set \nthe master up.  Nicor Gas Company appears to be their physical gas trading \narm, so that entity name should be left alone.\n\nI haven't forgotten the 8/11/00 list, I am waiting to hear back from \nAustralia about a question.\n",
