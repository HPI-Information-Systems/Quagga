  "text": "State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected \nTab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests \nLynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau\nFriday, March 16, 2001 \n,2001 San Francisco Chronicle \n\nSacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying \nelectrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential \ndocument obtained yesterday by The Chronicle. \nState power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging \n$49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers \nfigured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests. \nThe confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources, \nwhich purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of \nlawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom \nHannigan. \nTo the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much \nCalifornia is spending on power purchases. \nAlthough the document shows more money being spent than originally believed, \nit didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw \nit. \n\"I don't think it was a surprise,\" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R- \nRedding. \nAlthough the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity, \nanalysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could \njeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term. \nFor example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education \nprograms and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst \nwarned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in \nDavis' proposed budget. \nAlso, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit \nrating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the \nutilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a \ncredit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans \nto rise. \n\"This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,\" said Jean Ross, executive \ndirector of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that \ntracks state spending. \"Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the \nenergy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look \nlike in the future.\" \nThe biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent \nnearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest \nday was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per \nmegawatt hour. \nMichael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison & \nCo., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices. \n\"That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,\" he \nsaid. \"Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be.\" \nThe governor's office has refused to release information on how much the \nstate has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if \ngenerators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could \nforce up the price the next day. \nBut Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right \nto know how its money way being spent. \n\"People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,\" he \nsaid. \"We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces.\" \nStrickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have \nfiled public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state \nhas spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by \nDavis. \nThe original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated \nonly $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if \nneeded for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has \nsent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional \nmoney was needed. \nBased on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5 \nbillion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending \n$43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water \nResources document. \nSince the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has \nbecome dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a \nhouse of cards. \nThe money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is \nsupposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds.
