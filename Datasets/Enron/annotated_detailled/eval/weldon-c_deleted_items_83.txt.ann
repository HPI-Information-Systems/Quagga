Following my lecture, she approached me in the\nschool hallway. Despite the crowsfeet around her eyes, a tattling detail\nthat pegged her on the high side of 40, she had decked herself in the\nperennially adolescent costume of a 1960s hippie: bandanna in the\nfrizzed hair, faded blue jeans, and a pearl-button shirt best described\nas vaguely Navaho and LSD.\n\nShe smiled self-consciously, then raised a scold's finger: \"You write\nbooks about war, right? With the end of the Cold War and so many people\nwaging peace, I guess you'll have to find another subject, eh?\"\n\nRead more at http://gopusa.com/austinbay/ab_010202.shtml\n\n========================================================================\n\nPost-Christmas Wrap-Up\nBy Frederick Meekins\n\nEach year I write at least one column detailing the ongoing assault\nagainst Christmas throughout Western society.  Usually this affront is\nled by a gaggle of secularists, liberals, and multiculturalists.\nHowever, this year there seems to be a festering opposition led by\ncertain Christians to the yuletide season. Even though these criticisms\nhave not yet risen to the level of disruptive street theater engaged in\nby their unbelieving counterparts, they nevertheless reveal a somewhat\ndubious ecclesio-social philosophy.\n\nThe basic Christian anti-Christmas argument runs something like this:\nsince the commemoration of Christmas is not explicitly commanded by\nScripture, its celebration is therefore forbidden.  Furthermore, since\ncertain aspects of the holiday might be traceable to pagan origins, the\ncommitted Christian is obligated to have no parts of them.\n\nRead more at http://gopusa.com/opinion/fm_010302.shtml\n\n========================================================================\n\nSUBSCRIBE TODAY!
