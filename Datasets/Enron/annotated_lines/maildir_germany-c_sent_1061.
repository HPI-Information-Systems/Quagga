B>Transco
B>Beverly has all the numbers.  Either Scott or Beavy needs to go into Transit 
B>as Enron North America tomorrow morning and execute the 4 segments listed.  
B>Beavy has the offer numbers.  We will have (hopefully) 115,000 dt's of pure 
B>3-3 segmented capacity, all on k#.7537.
B>
B>Dan, next week we can probably create at least another 40,000 effective next 
B>Wed.
B>
B>Tetco
B>We ran out of credit on ECT.  Scott will talk to Trish Meigs about that in 
B>the morning.  Kathy has a list of all the offer numbers that need to be 
B>executed.  AFTER the all offers have been executed, have Meredith check 
B>screen AN52 effective 4/1/2000.  Kathy, you might be able to do this too.  
B>
B>Dan, I think you will be hurting for Tetco capacity.  Remember, we did 
B>release 3500 dts of Ela to M2 to IGS.
B>
B>CNG
B>We have no fuel waivers from Canajoharie for April.  I just never got around 
B>to requesting them.  
B>
B>Scott, Call Cindy McGinnis at 304-623-8854 and ask for fuel waivers on 
B>contract 5A2500 from Iroq/Canojaharie (meter 41101) to the following meters
B>NIMO East 20550, NIMO West 20500, East Ohio 20100, NYSEG 20700, RG&E 20600, 
B>and Hanley & Bird 21100.  I left her a voicemail to call you.  Ask her if we 
B>can send in the paperwork next week.  Let Scott Hendrickson, Robin, and Dick 
B>know what fuel waivers CNG approves.  I have all the CNG contracts on the 
B>worksheet.
B>
B>I will be calling in the morining.
