H>=09=09 Subject: Briefing on FERC CA Natural Gas Infrastructure conference
B>
B>This memo by Nancy Bagot, ETS, and Donna Fulton, Enron Corp, summarizes wha=
B>t=20
B>we heard at yesterday's FERC conference and gets to the heart of the issue =
B>in=20
B>California on the gas side.
B>
B>The FERC Technical Conference yesterday was held by FERC staff and was kept=
B>=20
B>to very technical, facility and service issues.  Staff did not allow any=20
B>discussion of pricing, because that would be handled in other forums.=20
B>Commissioners did not make an appearance at the conference, though some of=
B>=20
B>their staffers were in attendance.
B>
B>Like many FERC Technical Conferences, the May 24th conference on California=
B>=20
B>Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure boiled down to parties blaming=20
B>other parties for the situation in the California market.  Generally, (1)=
B>=20
B>interstate pipelines and others believe more infrastructure is needed, both=
B>=20
B>to California and within California   (and some blame SoCalGas=01, lack of=
B>=20
B>adequate take-away capacity, failure to provide open access transmission, a=
B>nd=20
B>allocation procedures), (2) SoCalGas blames the CPUC and believes that,=20
B>although this is a tight year, service commitments will be met and things a=
B>re=20
B>fine, and (3) the CPUC and CEC believe things are not out of control going=
B>=20
B>forward, that their own open proceedings are adequate to handle any gas=20
B>issues in California, and  that CPUC =01&decisions are coming.=018 =20
B>
B>For FERC Staff, there are two issues at hand: is the problem the mismatch=
B>=20
B>between interstate and intrastate capacity (and what amount of infrastructu=
B>re=20
B>should be added into and within California), and/or is it the allocation=20
B>methodology at a few highly-constrained delivery points into the state. =20
B>Overall, there is basic agreement that there are problems with both.
B>
B>The State
B>
B>Both the CPUC and the CEC described the intrastate pipeline system as=20
B>adequate with just minor changes and enhancements, certainly to serve core=
B>=20
B>customers and likely to serve non-core customers.  Like the LDCs, the state=
B>=20
B>representatives are concerned that building to develop a cushion in a=20
B>difficult year may not bode well for facilities in =01&normal=018 years in =
B>the=20
B>future, leaving intrastate capacity stranded.  Also, both agencies ticked o=
B>ff=20
B>a laundry list of proposed LDC enhancement projects and regulatory changes=
B>=20
B>that are designed to improve the delivery system.  According to the CPUC an=
B>d=20
B>CEC, demand in the state is not going to explode =01) getting LDC storage b=
B>ack=20
B>up to normal levels should make the difference.
B>
B>FERC Staff questioned  the CPUC and CEC speakers at length on the operation=
B>s=20
B>of the state LDC systems, allocation methods, and the availability of firm=
B>=20
B>capacity on SoCalGas in particular.  There was great concern among Staff=20
B>about the inability for a non-core customer to contract for specific capaci=
B>ty=20
B>for primary firm service on SoCal.  The CPUC noted that there is a=20
B>comprehensive settlement before the Commission to unbundle SoCal capacity a=
B>nd=20
B>allow for tradable primary capacity on an open access system, but the=20
B>Commission has not yet acted on that settlement.  When asked why the CPUC h=
B>as=20
B>not acted on the settlement that has been pending for a year, the witness=
B>=20
B>said that there were not three votes.
B>
B>The LDCs
B>
B>Only PG&E and SoCalGas appeared before FERC.  Both were adamant that there=
B>=20
B>was adequate capacity for current demand, as proven by the lack of =20
B>curtailments over the past year.  They also agree that a primary question i=
B>s=20
B>how to agree on the adequate amount of capacity =01) though it=01,s general=
B>ly held=20
B>there should be a 15-20% excess, is that for a normal weather year or a dry=
B>=20
B>hydro year? =20
B>
B>For SoCal in particular, Lad Lorenz claimed that demand would drop in the=
B>=20
B>next five years, with normal weather and a reduction of EG load which would=
B>=20
B>bypass their system (being built directly along interstates pipelines).  If=
B>=20
B>capacity were built to match an excess reserve margin, he wanted to know wh=
B>o=20
B>would pay for the capacity.  The central policy question for SoCal comes do=
B>wn=20
B>to defining excess capacity and modeling for excess based either on matchin=
B>g=20
B>interstate capacity or customer demand (based on contracts).  SoCal believe=
B>s=20
B>it should respond to the latter.  However, the LDC cites the CPUC as an=20
B>obstacle for responding to customers, and is looking to the CPUC to accept=
B>=20
B>its comprehensive settlement which will unbundle its capacity and allow for=
B>=20
B>tradable primary capacity rights.
B>
B>For PG&E, the situation is different because it functions very much like an=
B>=20
B>open access interstate pipeline. It does not have the allocation and=20
B>scheduling issues that are on the SoCal system; however, there is still a=
B>=20
B>mismatch between interstate and intrastate capacity.  PG&E, like SoCal,=20
B>claims that its system is adequate to meet current demand, though they are=
B>=20
B>planning some enhancements. They do agree with SoCal on the difficulty in=
B>=20
B>planning for uncertainty, but in general the northern California LDC is not=
B>=20
B>facing the difficulties of its southern counterpart.
B>
B>Staff questions underscore the more difficult situation on the SoCal system=
B>,=20
B>as nearly all questions focused on SoCal=01,s allocation method, firm capac=
B>ity=20
B>availability for non-core customers (which include industrials and electric=
B>=20
B>generation) and possible disconnects between its local and backbone systems=
B>. =20
B>FERC also queried about interstate and intrastate mismatches at Topock and=
B>=20
B>Wheeler Ridge, and whether these would be worsened with the addition of mor=
B>e=20
B>interstate capacity.  SoCal consistently answered that its proposed=20
B>comprehensive settlement on unbundling would resolve most issues, but the=
B>=20
B>CPUC will not act on it.
B>
B>Interstate Pipelines
B>
B>With every interstate pipeline serving California planning expansions and=
B>=20
B>four entirely new pipelines on the drafting table, the pipelines call to ar=
B>ms=20
B>was for more capacity into the state.  Demand projections by the pipeline=
B>=20
B>representatives were vast and optimistic, an example being the Sonoran=20
B>Pipeline prediction of a 3 =01) 4 Bcf shortfall.  And each pipe can point t=
B>o=20
B>booming open season results as proof of the need for more infrastructure. =
B>=20
B>Posing an obstacle to this infrastructure development is SoCalGas=01, lack =
B>of=20
B>capacity and the major problem of allocation =01) SoCal currently can only =
B>offer=20
B>secondary capacity to any new interstate capacity. =20
B>
B>FERC Staff agreed that the SoCal allocation is a problem and further proof=
B>=20
B>that there is a mismatch between intra and interstate capacity.  SoCal=20
B>responded that any new interstate capacity at certain desirable points will=
B>=20
B>only degrade existing service and again blamed the CPUC and the pipes=01,=
B>=20
B>allocations.  The other concern expressed by Staff is the divergent demand=
B>=20
B>forecasts of the LDCs, CPUC & CEC, and the pipelines.
B>
B>Others
B>
B>The financial community (Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch) pointed to a=20
B>dysfunctional market in California and told FERC that pipelines must be giv=
B>en=20
B>certainty on returns and the regulatory structure.  The message was for FER=
B>C=20
B>to stay the course, without price caps or changes to the marketing affiliat=
B>e=20
B>rules, and for California to fix itself, especially the CPUC (the weakest=
B>=20
B>link).
B>
B>Producers and End Users are concerned that existing shippers=01, rights are=
B>=20
B>protected and rates remain unaffected by expansions that may later be=20
B>stranded.  There is concern over additional capacity into constrained=20
B>delivery points that are already pro rationed, especially in light of the=
B>=20
B>recent nomination gaming debacle at Wheeler Ridge. =20
B>
B>The California Generators claimed that they were not convinced that SoCal=
B>=20
B>will be unloaded by bypassing EG.  They claimed that there are disincentive=
B>s=20
B>in California regulation to SoCal's building capacity - specifically the=20
B>Performance-based Rate mechanism and the Gas Cost Incentive mechanism.  Und=
B>er=20
B>these programs, SoCal gets to keep 50% of peaking service revenues, thus=20
B>giving SoCal incentive to advantage their own storage services.  SoCal gets=
B>=20
B>to keep tens of millions annually under these mechanisms.=20
B>
B>Closing Staff Concerns
B>
B>To wrap up, FERC Staff asked why it is Topock in particular that is always=
B>=20
B>discussed, and it was explained that access to multiple pipelines at Topock=
B>=20
B>has set it up as the preferred delivery point into California.  However, wi=
B>th=20
B>allocation changes at Topock kicking in, the problems are moving to Wheeler=
B>=20
B>Ridge.
B>
B>There was also a debate over which is the real problem =01) intrastate capa=
B>city=20
B>or intrastate scheduling.  SoCal again emphasized that it is not a capacity=
B>=20
B>issue but the mechanism (blame the CPUC for not approving the unbundling=20
B>settlement), California Generators believe it=01,s all about capacity (blam=
B>e=20
B>SoCalGas).
B>
B>Future Comments
B>
B>Comments can be filed in this proceeding by June 25.  Since the SoCal=20
B>settlement received so much attention and continues to await action by the=
B>=20
B>CPUC, should we get supporters of that settlment to file with the FERC=20
B>stating that this was a fix to some of the problems on SoCal's  system and=
B>=20
B>the CPUC has sat on it? =20
B>
B>We should find out who is planning to file comments.  Though much was said =
B>at=20
B>the technical conference, many speakers brought slides, and there was a Cou=
B>rt=20
B>Reporter, Commissioners and their staffers will not likely read the whole=
B>=20
B>transcript.  We could file to emphasize the points that are made in=20
B>Jennifer's gas talking points. =20
