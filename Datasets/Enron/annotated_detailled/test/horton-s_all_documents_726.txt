Dear Stan:

I greatly appreciated the opportunity to meet with you on Tuesday, and 
recognize
that the length of our meeting disrupted your schedule.  I thank you for your
frankness during our discussion.

I do want to reiterate that the business operations of GRI and IGT are
significantly different than those of a utility.  In addition, the evaluation
performed over the past six months has shown that the "mechanical" aspects of
the merger are straightforward.  I believe that basing a CEO selection
dominantly on these two criteria would subject the merged entity to an
unnecessary risk of failure.

Critical to the success of the Institute will be its ability to deliver
demonstrable value to its customers.  All of the critical building blocks will
exist at the combined Institute.  To capitalize on this opportunity, the 
leader
must be able to foster a creative, entrepreneurial environment in which
integrated teams work in concert, not in strife.

I encourage you to speak with members of both current and past organizations
that I have headed to gage the level of excitement and commitment that I have
been able to instill and my ability to create an atmosphere of mutual support
and respect from an initial environment of conflict.  My resume documents the
bottom line profit/loss impact that results from these effective teams.

During our discussion you asked if I could work effectively with Bill as the 
COO
of the "Institute."  Not only is the answer clearly yes, I emphasize that even
during last year when conflict between GRI and IGT became visible to DOE, Bill
and I made joint visits and presentations to DOE and others to provide a

front? and mitigate adverse effects.  During the past six months, I have had 
the
opportunity to work closely with Bill and sincerely believe that he would
provide a complementary set of skills and capabilities.

The 300 people that will initially form the Institute deserve the maximum
opportunity for success.  I firmly believe that I have demonstrated the
commitment, leadership skills and energy necessary to successfully merge the
best aspects of GRI and IGT. I do not believe that you will be able to 
identify
another individual that has as high a likelihood of forging an integrated team
that will maximize the impact of the Institute on its current and future
customer bases.

I look forward to our continued interactions.

Stan Borys
