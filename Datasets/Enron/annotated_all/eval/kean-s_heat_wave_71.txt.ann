  "text": "Cal-ISO: underscheduling caused grid failures\n  \n09/28/2000 \nMegawatt Daily \n(c) Copyright 2000 Pasha Publications, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \nUnder-scheduling of load on the part of California's utilities caused \nreliability problems in the state's electricity grid this summer, Ziad \nAlaywan, the managing director of engineering and support at the California \nIndependent System Operator (Cal-ISO) said. Speaking at a Cal-ISO stakeholder \nmeeting this week, Alaywan said Cal-ISO was forced to spend over $100 million \nin out-of-market purchases this summer in order to cover unscheduled load not \npurchased by the utilities in the day-ahead markets. \nA confluence of factors added up to create the emergency situations the \nCal-ISO faced this summer, according to Alaywan. He cited arbitrage between \nthe California Power Exchange (Cal PX) and Cal-ISO markets, a reliance on \nreal-time (rather than day-ahead) markets and a general shortage of power \nsupply in California as reasons why California's power grid was stretched to \nits limits this summer. \nAccording to figures presented by Alaywan, the instance of under-scheduling \nwas some 50% higher this summer than in the two previous summers. This \nunder-scheduling resulted in a total of 36 stage 1 and 2 emergencies between \nJune 1 and August 15 and dictated that the ISO curtail 13,450 MW on 12 \ndifferent occasions. In addition, the ISO spent $100,820,000 on out-of-market \nelectricity purchases during that period, up from $790,000 the previous year. \nAs a solution, Alaywan suggested increasing incentives to engage in forward \nscheduling of power and that supply be increased. The Cal-ISO has made a \nrequest for proposals for some 3000 MW for next summer to be used as a \npeaking management tool, as well as allotting $800 million for transmission \nupgrades over the next five years, Alaywan said. \nElena Schmid, Cal-ISO's vice president of strategic development and \ncommunication, also speaking at the meeting cited insufficient generation, \ninadequate transmission, under-scheduling of load, a lack of price responsive \ndemand, and the exercise of market power as market failures handicapping the \nISO's smooth delivery of power. To combat these shortcomings, Jeanne Sole, in \ncharge of long-term grid planning at the ISO, suggested that the ISO \nencourage expansion of the gird and the competitive provision of electricity \nfor the California market. Changes must be made in the ISO and other entities \ninvolved in power transmission and regulation over the next 18 months to \nlessen the likelihood of such problems occurring in the future, the speakers \nsaid.
